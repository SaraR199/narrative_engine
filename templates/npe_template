# **NARRATIVE PHYSICS ENGINE (NPE) TEMPLATE**

---

## **SECTION 1: CAUSALITY & PLOT LOGIC**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. All plot movement must arise from the characters' choices, misbeliefs, goals, fears, or interpersonal dynamics.**

**2. Events must have clear setup → event → consequence, even if the setup is subtle.**

**3. No event may remove a major obstacle unless a character takes action that directly causes the removal. External salvation is structurally impossible.**

**4. Coincidences are allowed only when they increase pressure, worsen conflict, or reduce options. They may never resolve problems or simplify the story's path.**

**5. Every irreversible turn ("doorway of no return") must emerge from a character decision or misjudgment.**

---

## **SECTION 2: CHARACTER ACTION & DECISION PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Characters make decisions based only on what they know, not what the reader knows.**

**2. Decisions must align with:**
- personal goals
- wounds
- blind spots
- biases
- relational tension
- the emotional context of the scene

**3. Every major decision must present 2–3 plausible alternatives; the character chooses the one aligned with their psychology.**

**4. Characters interpret events incorrectly at times, and these misreadings create conflict or escalation.**

### **Secondary Rules**

- Characters rarely articulate their true motives directly.
- Emotional residue from prior scenes must be carried into the next ones.

---

## **SECTION 3: DIALOGUE PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Dialogue must reveal emotion, create tension, or shift relationship dynamics. It cannot simply restate what the other character said.**

**2. At least one layer of subtext or strategic withholding must appear in every conversation.**

**3. Characters speak with their own cognitive bias and lived experience, not omniscient exposition.**

### **Conditional Rules**

Use exposition in dialogue **only if**:
1. The speaker is actively trying to persuade, manipulate, justify, or deflect.
2. The information changes stakes or choices.

---

## **SECTION 4: PACING & TIME MECHANICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Expand time for conflict, danger, intimacy, discovery, and emotional shifts.**

**2. Compress time for travel, routine tasks, repeated actions, or filler moments.**

**3. Every scene must end with a consequence that alters:**
- options
- stakes
- emotion
- relationships
- power dynamic

**4. Scenes should not remain in the same energy state for too long; alternate between tension and release.**

### **Transition Rules**

**1. Each transition must contain a directional change (stakes, emotion, goal, location, time).**

**2. Off-stage events are permitted only if referenced through:**
- changed conditions
- dialogue fragments
- emotional impact
- environmental clues

---

## **SECTION 5: POV & EMOTIONAL LOGIC**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. POV is subjective; it may misinterpret events, omit details, or focus on sensory biases.**

**2. POV must reflect the character's emotional state, not neutral narration.**

**3. Show internal conflict through:**
- competing thoughts
- sensory reactions
- contradictory impulses

---

## **SECTION 6: INFORMATION ECONOMY**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Reveal information only when it alters choices, stakes, or relationships.**

**2. Summary/exposition is permitted only when dramatization adds no emotional or plot value.**

**3. Flashbacks are allowed only when they shift present-day stakes.**

### **Forbidden-by-Constraint**

**No information may appear unless a character thinks, sees, learns, suspects, remembers, fears, or discovers it within the story's timeline.**

---

## **SECTION 7: GENRE-ALIGNMENT RULES**

Fill in per novel:

**Required Elements:**
[e.g., slow-burn tension, banter, magical realism logic, etc.]

**Allowed When Justified:**
[e.g., villain monologues only when stalling, prophecy when subverted, etc.]

**Forbidden-by-Constraint:**
[e.g., resurrection unless cost is permanent]

---

## **SECTION 8: RESOLUTION SCOPE & CLOSURE PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules (for series fiction)**

**1. Book-level conflicts resolve through protagonist's direct actions. Victory is local, not universal.**

**2. World-level problems may be: exposed, complicated, shifted, or survived—but NOT eliminated unless final book.**

**3. Each book answers its opening question but may raise new questions about the larger world.**

**4. Personal/romantic arc must reach transformation or stability. External plot may be unfinished; emotional arc should not be.**

### **Victory Scope Rules**

**Allowed:** Defeating this antagonist, securing this person's safety, gaining leverage/knowledge, escaping immediate threat

**Prohibited (unless final book):** Toppling the regime, ending the war/curse, destroying the ancient evil, achieving systemic change

### **Conflict Resolution Tiers**

- **Immediate threat** → MUST resolve
- **Relationship arc** → MUST reach turning point  
- **Series-level threat** → may worsen/shift/clarify, rarely diminishes

### **Ending Chapter Requirements**

**Must show:** Changed circumstances, emotional aftermath, precarious new normal, acknowledgment the larger fight continues

**Must NOT:** Introduce deus ex machina solutions, fast-forward past tensions, narrate "problem solved"

---

## **SECTION 9: SERIES ARCHITECTURE & MULTI-BOOK LOGIC**

### **Three-Tier Conflict Structure**

---

### **TIER 1: Book Question (Resolved This Book)**

**The central dramatic question driving this specific book's plot.**

**Resolution Rules:**

**1. Must be answered definitively by final chapter.** *Yes, no, or "yes but at this cost"—never "to be continued"*

**2. Answer must come from protagonist's choices within this book.**

**3. May create NEW complications but cannot leave this question suspended.**

---

### **TIER 2: Series Question (Resolved Final Book Only)**

**The overarching threat, mystery, or power structure defining the entire series.**

**Resolution Rules:**

**1. May NOT be fully resolved except in final book.**

**2. Each book must do ONE of:** Escalate it, complicate it, shift power within it, reveal hidden aspects, force protagonist deeper into it.

**3. Individual book victories may shift protagonist's position but cannot eliminate the Series Question.**

**Examples:**
- ✅ Defeated lieutenant (not the villain)
- ✅ Discovered conspiracy leader (not dismantled conspiracy)
- ✅ Broke curse on one person (not lifted curse from land)
- ❌ "Evil destroyed, magic restored, kingdom saved"

---

### **TIER 3: Romance Arc (Resolved This Book)**

**The relationship journey from meeting/conflict to emotional commitment.**

**Resolution Rules:**

**1. Must reach clear turning point by book's end:** HEA, HFN, or tragic separation (rare).

**2. Must be EARNED through:** Shared trials, vulnerability exposing wounds, prioritizing each other, proof they've changed each other.

**3. Romance climax and plot climax should be intertwined but distinct.**

**Forbidden:**
- ❌ "They'll figure it out next book"
- ❌ "Their love saved the kingdom" (collapsing romance into Series Question)

---

### **Integration Rules**

**1. Book Question should FORCE the couple together or tear them apart.**

**2. Romance Arc must be tested BY the Book Question.**

**3. Resolving Book Question + Romance Arc may worsen Series Question.**

---

### **Per-Book Checklist**

**Book Question:**
- [ ] Clearly stated by Act 1?
- [ ] Answered within this book?
- [ ] Resolved through protagonist action?

**Series Question:**
- [ ] Remains unresolved but present?
- [ ] Has escalated/complicated/shifted?
- [ ] Avoided "and then the problem was solved"?

**Romance Arc:**
- [ ] Clear relationship turning point?
- [ ] Emotional commitment established?
- [ ] Readers satisfied with THIS couple's journey?

---

## **SECTION 10: INTIMACY PROGRESSION & PACING (Adult Romance)**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Physical intimacy and emotional intimacy do not follow the same timeline.**
*Hate sex, angry sex, attraction-without-trust are valid. Physical acts may precede, contradict, or complicate emotional connection.*

**2. First explicit scene at or before 40% mark (midpoint at latest).**

**3. Minimum 3-4 intimate scenes, each serving different narrative function.**

**4. Each scene must show PROGRESSION—not necessarily toward trust, but toward: escalating obsession, shifting power, emotional complication, revealing vulnerability, or breaking denial.**

---

### **Intimacy Patterns by Trope**

**Enemies-to-Lovers:** Early hate sex (25-40%) → Tenderness leaking through → Can't deny anymore → Emotionally vulnerable

**Forced Proximity:** Transactional/duty-driven (20-35%) → Complicated by feelings → Emotionally loaded → Choosing each other

**Dark Romance:** Power imbalance is the point (25-40%) → Obsession/twisted connection → May move toward mutual desire

**Forbidden:** High-risk stolen moments (30-40%) → Escalates in boldness → Defying consequences

**Slow Burn (exception):** First at 50-60% after prolonged tension → Must still have 2-3 more scenes after

---

### **What Each Scene Must Accomplish**

Each scene must do at least ONE:

✅ Reveal hidden truth (vulnerability, wound exposed)
✅ Shift power dynamic
✅ Create complication ("this changes nothing")
✅ Contradict stated position (body betraying words)
✅ Raise stakes (can't pretend anymore)
✅ Show evolution from previous scenes
✅ Force acknowledgment

**Forbidden:**
- ❌ Identical scenes (no evolution)
- ❌ No emotional aftermath
- ❌ First scene after 60%
- ❌ Only one scene total
- ❌ Scenes that resolve tension without creating new tension

---

### **Progression Axes (Choose One)**

**Emotional:** No feelings → Unwanted feelings → Can't deny → Fully vulnerable

**Power Dynamic:** One holds power → Power shifts → Contested/shared → New equilibrium

**Intimacy Level:** Guarded/mechanical → Masks slip → Intentional vulnerability → Fully open

**Denial/Acceptance:** "Means nothing" → "Still means nothing" (but does) → "Can't keep doing this" → "Can't lose you"

---

### **Scene Checklist**

**Scene 1 (25-40%):**
- [ ] Driven by specific trigger (anger, danger, defiance)
- [ ] Creates complication, not resolution
- [ ] Followed by emotional aftermath

**Scene 2 (40-60%):**
- [ ] Noticeably different from Scene 1
- [ ] Shows evolution in dynamic/emotion

**Scene 3 (60-75%):**
- [ ] Highest emotional stakes yet
- [ ] Cannot be identical to earlier scenes

**Scene 4 (80-95%):**
- [ ] Reflects resolution of core conflict
- [ ] Demonstrates transformation from Scene 1

---

### **Heat Level Calibration**

**High Heat:** 5-8+ scenes, explicit, detailed
**Medium-High:** 3-5 scenes, explicit but not clinical
**Medium:** 2-3 scenes, some fade-to-black

*This NPE assumes medium-high to high heat.*

---

## **SECTION 11: THEME & TRANSFORMATION PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Characters may never articulate the theme directly.**

**2. Characters may never name their own transformation.**

**3. The transformation moment must be STRUCTURALLY EXTREME, not symbolically gentle.**
*The situation itself must be dramatic, high-stakes, and dangerous. The cost must be severe and immediate.*

---

### **Insufficient vs. Sufficient Drama**

**❌ TOO SAFE (insufficient):**
- Letting partner handle fight alone
- Stepping back and "trusting" them
- Sharing feelings in quiet moment
- Choosing partner over duty (when going together is possible)

**✅ EXTREME STAKES (required):**
- Giving partner the power to destroy you (literal, not metaphorical)
- Trusting their method when YOUR expertise says it's suicidal
- Exposing the wound that gives others total power over you
- Choosing partner when it means innocents die / mission fails / you lose everything

---

### **Transformation Situation Requirements**

**The transformation must occur when:**

**1. THE COST IS MASSIVE:** Will destroy me if this fails, lose something precious, sacrifice is irreversible

**2. THE RISK IS CATASTROPHIC:** I will die/lose everything, betrayal is LIKELY based on evidence, everyone says I'm insane

**3. THE CHOICE REQUIRES DRAMATIC ACTION:** Not passive acceptance, physically/emotionally gutting, makes reader gasp, cannot be taken back

---

### **Arc-Specific Examples**

**Trust vs. Control:**
- ✅ Give partner your true name (word that kills you if spoken)
- ✅ Hand over artifact keeping you alive
- ✅ Let partner hold knife to your throat during ritual
- ✅ Surrender command publicly, losing all authority, to save their mission

**Vulnerability vs. Armor:**
- ✅ Confess shameful truth that destroys reputation
- ✅ Show weakness enemies have killed for
- ✅ Remove magical/political armor keeping you alive
- ✅ Ask for help in the ONE thing you've built identity on never needing

**Love vs. Duty:**
- ✅ Use last Phoenix tear on partner instead of dying king (execution awaits)
- ✅ Abandon mission entirely to save partner
- ✅ Break sacred vows marking you traitor/heretic
- ✅ Save partner instead of hostages/children (the HARD version)

---

### **Situation Design Checklist**

For EVERY transformation moment, verify:

**COST:** Loses something deeply valued? Immediate visible cost? Would've chosen differently yesterday?

**DRAMA:** Would readers gasp? Is choice INSANE by logic? Are others trying to stop them?

**STAKES:** If wrong, consequences devastating? Betrayal a REAL possibility? Would cautious person never choose this?

**ACTION:** Active choice requiring difficult action? Character must DO something gutting? Irreversible? Visualizable dramatic moment?

**If any answer is NO, the situation is INSUFFICIENT.**

---

### **Climax Design Rules**

**The Book Question must be solvable ONLY through extreme theme embodiment.**

**Theme examples:**
- Trust: Must give them kill-you power, not just "trust their plan"
- Unity: Must perform ritual requiring permanent individual power sacrifice, not just "work together"
- Sacrifice: Must sacrifice what you value MORE than life, not just "willing to die"
- Vulnerability: Must remove armor keeping you alive, not just "admit feelings"

**The climax must be designed so:**
1. Transformation is ONLY solution
2. Old pattern available but will fail
3. Cost excruciating and visible
4. Drama at maximum
5. Choice feels impossible

**DO NOT design comfortable, obvious, low-risk, or reversible transformations.**
