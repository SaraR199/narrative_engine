## Step 1: NPE Extraction

**Required file:** `existing_outline.md`

This should contain an outline from another book project you've worked on. The workflow will analyze it to extract your generic writing preferences.

### What to Include

Your outline should contain:
- Plot structure and major story beats
- Character arcs and decision points
- Scene descriptions and pacing notes
- How stakes escalate over time
- Cause-and-effect chains
- Information release patterns
- Any dialogue or POV patterns you use

### Example Structure

```markdown
# [Book Title]

## Act 1
### Chapter 1: [Title]
- Scene 1: [Character] does X because Y, which causes Z...
- Stakes: ...
- Character arc: ...

### Chapter 2: [Title]
...

## Act 2
...
```

The more detailed your outline, the better the NPE extraction will capture your writing patterns.
