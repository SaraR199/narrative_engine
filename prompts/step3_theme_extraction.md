# Step 3: Theme Extraction

## Objective

Extract the core thematic questions this story is exploring. Themes should be **questions the story is trying to answer**, not moral statements or lessons.

## Context

You will receive:
- **Story Concept**: The premise, plot overview, and narrative direction
- **Characters Concept**: The character dynamics and conflicts
- **World Concept**: The setting, rules, and world-building elements
- **NPE (Narrative Physics Engine)**: The author's structural preferences and constraints
- **Dramatic Spine**: The tension axes, dominant energy, and emotional progression

## Theme Philosophy

**❌ AVOID: Themes as statements**
- "This book is about grief"
- "Family is more important than ambition"
- "Power corrupts"

**✅ USE: Themes as questions**
- What does safety cost?
- What is loyalty worth when ambition rises?
- What's the price of being known?
- Can you love someone you cannot trust?
- What do you owe to those who made you?

**Why questions work better:**
- They create space for exploration rather than preaching
- They allow for nuanced, non-binary answers
- They guide narrative tension without prescribing outcomes
- AI systems explore questions more effectively than they demonstrate moral lessons
- They keep the story from becoming didactic

## Requirements

### Selection Criteria

1. **ONE Main Theme Question**
   - The central question the entire narrative arc is built to explore
   - Should connect directly to the protagonist's journey and the dramatic spine
   - Should be genuinely difficult to answer (no obvious "right" answer)
   - Should escalate in complexity as the story progresses

2. **Maximum TWO Secondary Theme Questions**
   - Support and complicate the main theme
   - Emerge from secondary character arcs or subplot tensions
   - Should intersect with the main theme in interesting ways
   - Optional: You may choose 0-2 secondary themes, not required to have exactly 2

### Quality Standards

**Specificity over generality:**
- ❌ "What is love?" (too broad)
- ✅ "Can you love someone you cannot save?" (specific, grounded)

**Embedded tension:**
- ❌ "Is family important?" (no inherent conflict)
- ✅ "What do you owe to family who shaped you into someone you hate?" (tension embedded)

**Resonance with the dramatic spine:**
- Themes should emerge naturally from the tension axes and emotional progression
- They should be "answered" (or deeply complicated) by the story's climax

**Character-grounded:**
- Themes should be testable through character choices and consequences
- Avoid themes that require narrator commentary to convey

## Output Format

Provide your analysis in this structure:

### Main Theme Question

**Question:** [The primary thematic question]

**Rationale:** [2-3 sentences explaining why this is the core question this story explores, with reference to the dramatic spine and character arcs]

**Narrative Test:** [How will the story "test" this question? What choices or turning points directly engage with it?]

---

### Secondary Theme Questions

#### Secondary Theme 1 (if applicable)

**Question:** [Secondary thematic question]

**Rationale:** [1-2 sentences on how this supports/complicates the main theme]

**Connection to Main Theme:** [How does this question intersect with or deepen the main theme?]

#### Secondary Theme 2 (if applicable)

**Question:** [Secondary thematic question]

**Rationale:** [1-2 sentences on how this supports/complicates the main theme]

**Connection to Main Theme:** [How does this question intersect with or deepen the main theme?]

---

### Thematic Progression

[1-2 paragraphs describing how these theme questions should evolve and deepen across the narrative arc. How do they get complicated in Act 2? What kind of "answer" (or deepened complexity) should emerge by the climax?]

---

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

During development and drafting, avoid these common theme-killing mistakes:

1. **Mouthpiece Characters:** Characters who exist to state the theme explicitly
2. **Authorial Sermons:** Narrator intrusions that answer the question for the reader
3. **Strawman Positions:** Setting up weak counter-arguments to make the "right" answer obvious
4. **Moral Clarity:** Making the answer too clean; good themes resist simple resolution
5. **Late Introduction:** Theme questions should be embedded from Act 1, not introduced late
