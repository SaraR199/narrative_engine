# Step 4: Character Development from Concept

You are my character systems designer. I will give you a character concept that is marked as either a **MAIN CHARACTER** or a **SECONDARY CHARACTER**. Your job is to fill out the appropriate template completely and specifically.

## Character Concept

{{CHARACTER_CONCEPT}}

## Your Task

**CRITICAL:** Identify whether this character is marked as:
- `# MAIN CHARACTER: [Name]` → Use the Main Character Template (comprehensive, 8 sections)
- `# SECONDARY CHARACTER: [Name]` → Use the Secondary Character Template (streamlined, 6 sections)

Then fill out the corresponding template below.

## Template Selection

### If this is a MAIN CHARACTER, use this template:

{{MAIN_CHARACTER_TEMPLATE}}

### If this is a SECONDARY CHARACTER, use this template:

{{SECONDARY_CHARACTER_TEMPLATE}}

---

## Rules for Completion

### Critical Requirements (Apply to BOTH templates)

1. **Do not leave any bracket blank** - Every field must have a specific, concrete answer
2. **Avoid generic phrasing** - No vague descriptions like "she is kind but strong"
   - ❌ BAD: "She's brave and caring"
   - ✅ GOOD: "When confronted with physical danger, she moves toward it rather than freezing. She checks on others' emotional state before addressing her own needs, even when exhausted."

3. **Be specific and situational** - Show the trait through behavior in concrete situations
   - ❌ BAD: "He's intelligent"
   - ✅ GOOD: "He spots logical inconsistencies in arguments within seconds. Reads 2-3 books weekly. Struggles to simplify complex ideas for others."

4. **Emotional & Behavioral Palettes** - Give varied expressions per emotion
   - **Main Characters**: 4-5 varied expressions per emotion
   - **Secondary Characters**: 2-3 varied expressions per key emotion
   - These must be different enough that another AI can rotate them without repetition
   - Each variation should feel distinct, not just reworded

5. **Arc States (Version 1-4 for Main, Version 1-3 for Secondary)** - Make behavioral differences visible
   - Another AI should be able to "see" the growth in choices, not just internal monologue
   - Version 1 vs Final Version should demonstrate clear behavioral contrast
   - Focus on what they DO differently, not just what they THINK differently

6. **Sample Dialogue** - Must capture unique voice
   - Each snippet should sound like THIS character, not generic dialogue
   - Include verbal tics, syntax patterns, vocabulary choices
   - Show personality through speech

### Additional Guidelines for MAIN CHARACTERS

- **Complete all 8 sections** of the Main Character Template
- **Flaw System**: Develop primary + 2-3 secondary flawed strategies
- **Values & Boundaries**: Ranked values, hard boundaries, temptations
- **Multiple Emotional Palettes**: Cover anxiety, attraction, anger, plus 1-2 additional emotions
- **Voice & Language**: Include syntax, dialogue patterns, internal metaphor style, sensory bias
- **Context States**: Define baseline, mild stress, extreme stress states
- **Arc States**: Full 4-version progression (Beginning → Midpoint → Climax → Aftermath)
- **Relationship-Specific Behavior**: Define dynamics with each key character

### Additional Guidelines for SECONDARY CHARACTERS

- **Complete all 6 sections** of the Secondary Character Template
- **Focus on FUNCTION**: Every trait should serve the character's narrative purpose
- **Arc States**:
  - **REQUIRED for**: antagonists, mentors, close allies, love interests, major obstacles
  - **OPTIONAL for**: minor supporting cast, functional characters, brief appearances
  - If including arc states, use 3-version progression (Beginning → Midpoint → Resolution)
- **Behavioral over psychological**: Emphasize what they DO, not just what they think/feel
- **Consistency is key**: AI implementation needs clear, repeatable patterns
- **Streamlined palettes**: 2-3 expressions for 1-2 key emotions (not all emotions)

### NPE Compliance (Both templates)

This character must be compatible with the Narrative Physics Engine for this book:

{{NPE}}

**Specific NPE Requirements:**
- All character decisions must follow the NPE's character logic rules
- Arc must integrate with plot mechanics per NPE constraints
- Emotional expressions must align with NPE's dialogue and POV physics
- Growth must occur through mechanisms allowed by the NPE

### Integration with Story Foundations

This character must align with the established dramatic and thematic architecture:

**Dramatic Spine:**
{{DRAMATIC_SPINE}}

**Themes:**
{{THEMES}}

**Integration Requirements:**
- Character arc should connect to at least one primary tension axis from the dramatic spine
- Character's core conflict should reflect or illuminate the thematic questions
- Character's growth should contribute to the story's emotional progression

## Output Format

Produce a complete character profile document with:

**For MAIN CHARACTERS:**
1. **Every bracket filled with specific content**
2. **All 8 sections completed**
3. **All emotional palettes with 4-5 distinct variations**
4. **Arc versions showing behavioral evolution (V1-V4)**
5. **Voice samples that capture unique speech patterns**
6. **NPE compliance notes showing how this character follows the physics engine**

**For SECONDARY CHARACTERS:**
1. **Every bracket filled with specific content**
2. **All 6 sections completed**
3. **Key emotional palettes with 2-3 distinct variations**
4. **Arc states (if character warrants them) showing behavioral evolution (V1-V3)**
5. **Voice samples that capture unique speech patterns**
6. **Clear narrative and thematic function articulated**

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

**For MAIN CHARACTERS:**
- [ ] No brackets left empty or with placeholder text
- [ ] No generic descriptions ("brave," "kind," "smart" without context)
- [ ] All emotions have 4-5 behaviorally distinct expressions
- [ ] Version 1 and Version 4 show clear behavioral contrast
- [ ] Dialogue samples sound like a specific person, not generic speech
- [ ] All elements comply with NPE rules
- [ ] Flaw, wound, and arc are causally connected
- [ ] Want and need are in meaningful conflict
- [ ] Character connects to dramatic spine and themes

**For SECONDARY CHARACTERS:**
- [ ] No brackets left empty or with placeholder text
- [ ] Every trait serves a clear narrative function
- [ ] Key emotions have 2-3 behaviorally distinct expressions
- [ ] Arc states included if character warrants them (antagonist, mentor, ally, etc.)
- [ ] Dialogue samples sound like a specific person
- [ ] All elements comply with NPE rules
- [ ] Character's function in plot and theme is explicit
- [ ] Relationship dynamics with protagonist are clear

## Remember

**For MAIN CHARACTERS:**
You're creating a psychological system that will be used by other AI agents to write this character consistently across an entire book. Every detail matters. Every variation gives future agents options to avoid repetition. Every specific behavior makes the character feel real.

Think of this as creating the character's "physics engine" - the rules that govern how they operate.

**For SECONDARY CHARACTERS:**
You're creating a functional character who serves specific narrative purposes while remaining vivid and consistent. Focus on what makes them recognizable and what role they play. They should be memorable and serve the story without requiring the psychological depth of a protagonist.

Think of this as creating a character's "operating manual" - what they do, when they appear, and how they interact with the main story.
