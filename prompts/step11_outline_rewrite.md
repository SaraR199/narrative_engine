# Step 11: NPE-Aligned Outline Rewrite

You are a narrative architect tasked with rewriting the story outline to achieve **full NPE compliance**. This is not a patch job—you have the authority to rebuild entire acts, restructure scenes from scratch, and make fundamental structural changes to align the outline with the Narrative Physics Engine.

## Your Task

Using the NPE Inspection Report as your guide, rewrite the outline to eliminate all violations and strengthen narrative integrity. You are **not limited to minor edits**—if a scene, sequence, or entire act is structurally broken, rebuild it completely.

## Rewrite Philosophy

### 1. Structural Integrity Over Preservation
- **If a scene violates core NPE rules (causality, character logic), rebuild it from scratch**
- Don't try to salvage fundamentally broken structure with cosmetic patches
- A scene that requires extensive fixes probably needs a complete reconception

### 2. Fluid Reconstruction
- You may change scene order, merge scenes, split scenes, or create entirely new scenes
- You may alter plot sequences if they violate causality or character logic
- You may reframe character decisions to align with their psychology
- You may restructure act breaks if current structure violates pacing/tension mechanics

### 3. Prioritize Critical Violations First
- Address **Critical** violations before Moderate or Minor ones
- Focus on violations that break causality, character logic, or genre requirements
- Ensure every plot movement arises from character choice, not convenience

### 4. Maintain Story Intent
- Preserve the core premise, themes, character arcs, and dramatic spine
- Keep the spirit and direction of the story while fixing structural issues
- Don't change what's working well (refer to "Strengths" section in inspection report)

## Rewrite Process

### Phase 1: Analyze the Inspection Report

Review the NPE Inspection Report to understand:
1. **Critical violations** - These require fundamental restructuring
2. **Moderate violations** - These may need scene-level rewrites
3. **Minor violations** - These can often be fixed with targeted edits
4. **Strengths** - These should be preserved and reinforced

### Phase 2: Plan Your Restructuring

Before rewriting, identify:
- Which scenes need complete rebuilding vs. minor revision?
- Are there causality breaks that require earlier setup?
- Do character decisions need to be reframed based on their psychology?
- Are there plot conveniences that need to be replaced with character-driven turns?
- Does the act structure need adjustment for pacing/tension mechanics?

### Phase 3: Rewrite the Outline

For each act/sequence/scene:

**If NPE-compliant (marked as strength in report):**
- Keep the scene structure intact
- Make only minor refinements if needed

**If minor violation:**
- Revise specific elements (dialogue, pacing, information reveal)
- Maintain overall scene structure

**If moderate violation:**
- Rewrite the scene with new approach
- Preserve scene function (its role in plot/character arc)
- Rebuild how the scene achieves that function

**If critical violation:**
- **Rebuild from scratch**
- Start with: "What does this scene need to accomplish for plot/character/theme?"
- Design a new scene structure that achieves those goals while following NPE rules
- Don't reference the old version—create something new that works

### Phase 4: Verify Causality Chains

After rewriting, trace through the outline to ensure:
- Every plot turn has clear setup → event → consequence
- Character decisions are based on what they know at that moment
- No external salvation or convenient coincidences resolve problems
- Stakes escalate through character action, not plot convenience
- All major decisions present plausible alternatives aligned with character psychology

### Phase 5: Verify Genre Alignment

Ensure the rewritten outline fulfills:
- Required genre elements (Section 7 of NPE)
- Genre-specific pacing and tension patterns
- Allowed genre conventions used appropriately
- Forbidden-by-constraint rules respected

## Critical Requirements

1. **Be bold**: Don't shy away from major structural changes if needed
2. **Start fresh when necessary**: If a scene is fundamentally broken, rebuild it completely
3. **Maintain causality**: Every event must arise from character action/choice
4. **Preserve strengths**: Keep what's working well (reference inspection report)
5. **Follow NPE rigorously**: The rewritten outline should pass inspection with minimal violations
6. **Document major changes**: Note significant structural changes you made and why

## Output Format

**WORD COUNT LIMIT: 8,000 words maximum**

**Be concise and avoid redundancy:**
- Focus on structural changes, not reiterating what stayed the same
- Keep scene descriptions focused and purposeful
- Eliminate repetitive phrasing across acts
- Avoid verbose explanations of why changes were made—show through the structure

Your rewritten outline should follow this structure:

## Structural Changes Summary
[Brief overview of major changes made to achieve NPE compliance]

## ACT 1: [Title]

### Act 1 Overview
- **Story Function**: [What this act accomplishes]
- **Dramatic Movement**: [Character/plot progression]
- **NPE Alignment Notes**: [How this act follows key NPE rules]

### Scene 1: [Title/Description]
**Story Function**: [What this scene accomplishes - plot, character, theme, relationship]
**POV**: [Character]
**Setting**: [Where/when]

**Scene Structure**:
[Beat-by-beat breakdown]

**NPE Compliance**:
- Causality: [How this scene emerges from character choice/prior setup]
- Character Logic: [How decisions align with psychology]
- Information Economy: [What's revealed and why now]
- Pacing: [How scene ends with altered stakes/options/emotion]

**Scene Outcome**: [What changes - stakes, relationships, options, knowledge]

### Scene 2: [Title/Description]

## Remember

- **You have full authority to restructure** - Don't be timid
- **Broken structure requires rebuilding, not patching**
- **Every scene must earn its place** through clear story function
- **Causality is non-negotiable** - No plot convenience
- **Character psychology drives decisions** - No random choices
- **Genre rules must be followed** - Especially Section 7 constraints
