# World Constraints Document

## Geography & Movement

**Core Constraints:**

- **The Warren's shifting geography**: Navigation requires either magical sense or a trusted guide. Characters without magical abilities or connections cannot safely traverse the space—getting lost means potential death or exposure to hostile factions
- **Sanctuary's rotating location**: Currently a warehouse, but moves regularly. Once placed in Sanctuary, characters are cut off from their regular lives, contacts, and resources. Leaving Sanctuary means losing its protection permanently—you can't come back once you've left
- **The Archive exists between buildings**: Accessible only through specific rituals or by those keyed into wards. Characters cannot access supernatural historical knowledge without either: (1) knowing the ritual, (2) being keyed in by an archivist, or (3) finding someone who has access and convincing them to share
- **The Crossroads neutrality**: Violence is forbidden and swiftly punished. Characters cannot use force to resolve conflicts here, even when threatened—attacking someone at the Crossroads brings Covenant enforcement down on you immediately
- **Supernatural spaces are localized**: Magic hubs, safe houses, and faction territories exist in specific geographic pockets. Characters outside these zones have no supernatural backup or resources

**Plotting Implications:**

Forces characters into dangerous alliances (need a Warren guide = trusting someone you shouldn't). Sanctuary becomes a pressure cooker—protection equals imprisonment with people you might hate. The Archive constraint means critical historical information about the Vanishing might exist but be inaccessible without paying prices characters can't afford. Crossroads neutrality creates strategic complications: enemies can approach you there knowing you can't retaliate physically, forcing political/verbal confrontation instead of action.

## Cultural & Social Rules

**Core Constraints:**

- **The Veil must be maintained at all costs**: Using obvious magic around humans, leaving supernatural evidence, or failing to maintain mundane cover risks exposing the entire community. Punishment for Veil breaches ranges from memory wipes to execution depending on severity
- **Covenant neutrality zones are sacrosanct**: Breaking neutrality at the Crossroads or similar spaces brings immediate Covenant enforcement—even powerful beings can't ignore this without becoming community targets
- **Factional loyalty determines safety**: Vampires and shifters maintain centuries of mutual suspicion. Mixed heritage beings belong nowhere and are trusted by no faction. Your supernatural species/heritage determines who you can safely approach and who considers you an enemy by default
- **Mundane cover identities are mandatory**: Every supernatural being must maintain plausible human life—job, residence, social connections. Losing your cover means losing access to human spaces and resources, increasing exposure risk
- **Information sharing = power transfer**: Telling someone your true nature, capabilities, or connections gives them leverage. The community operates on strategic withholding—trust is rare because knowledge is weaponizable
- **Sensitive humans are existential threats**: Humans who see through the Veil and remember what they see must be handled via Covenant protocol: memory alteration (unreliable), recruitment (risky), containment (imprisonment), or elimination (officially forbidden, quietly practiced). No other options exist

**Plotting Implications:**

Ryn's demon heritage means automatic distrust/hostility from multiple factions if exposed. Maintaining cover requires constant performance—one slip means danger. Characters cannot simply "tell the truth" to solve problems because truth-sharing creates vulnerabilities. The sensitive human protocols mean that any human witness to supernatural events becomes a crisis requiring immediate, morally fraught action. Factional divisions prevent easy alliances—asking a vampire coven for help against shifters might solve one problem while creating three new ones.

## Resource & Economic Pressures

**Core Constraints:**

- **Enforcers are chronically under-resourced**: Stretched thin across too much territory with too many crises. Backup is rarely available. Equipment and magical supplies come from personal resources or favors owed, not institutional support
- **The Archive charges for access**: Knowledge isn't free. Archivists exact prices (information, favors, magical energy, secrets) for research access. Characters cannot simply "look up" historical information—they must trade for it
- **Information is the premium currency**: In a community built on secrets, knowing someone's true identity, past actions, or current plans is more valuable than money or magical artifacts. Characters trade information, creating webs of debt and obligation
- **Forbidden magic has black market availability**: Dangerous practices (blood rituals, possession magic, reality-warping) are accessible to those desperate enough. Cost is corruption and magical fallout, but the option exists for characters who run out of legitimate solutions
- **The Covenant provides minimal support**: Official resources go to politically connected operatives. Marginalized characters (those in the Warren, exiles, those with questionable pasts like Ash) receive no institutional backing

**Plotting Implications:**

Ash and Ryn cannot call for backup when situations escalate—they're on their own. Investigating the Vanishing requires accessing Archive records, meaning accumulating debts to archivists that will be called in later. Information economy means every revelation creates political complications—learning something valuable makes you a target for those who want to control or suppress that knowledge. Desperate characters might turn to forbidden magic, creating collateral damage the protagonists must contain.

## Technology & Magic Limits

**Core Constraints:**

- **Magic always takes payment**: Stronger workings require higher costs—energy, emotion, years off your life, memories, pieces of yourself. Characters cannot spam powerful magic without accumulating damage
- **Blood magic corrodes the user**: Grants temporary power at permanent cost to the practitioner. Repeated use leaves visible corruption (physical deterioration, mental instability, moral decay)
- **Death magic demands equivalent exchange**: Always requires death in return, though not always the death you expect. Characters using death magic cannot control what the price will be
- **Magic cannot override free will cleanly**: Forcing genuine emotion or controlling someone's choices breaks something fundamental in the target, leaving them damaged. Mind control exists but creates obvious, traceable psychological harm
- **True resurrection is impossible**: Magic cannot bring back the dead without catastrophic cost (something world-ending or identity-destroying). Characters facing loss cannot be "fixed" through magical solutions
- **Magic leaves readable traces**: Skilled practitioners can identify who cast a spell, their emotional state, their intentions. Using magic is leaving evidence that investigative characters can follow
- **Material components matter**: Iron disrupts fae magic, salt creates barriers, silver harms shadow creatures. Characters must know what they're facing and have the right materials, or their magic/weapons are ineffective
- **Technology detects magic unpredictably**: Cell phones pick up magical frequencies as static. Security cameras capture impossible images before footage corrupts. AI and sensors increasingly breach the Veil's perceptual filter. Characters cannot rely on technology around magic, and every magical event risks creating viral digital evidence

**Plotting Implications:**

Characters cannot solve emotional problems (Ash's guilt, Ryn's identity crisis) through magical fixes—supernatural power escalates danger but doesn't replace growth. Every major magical working costs something, forcing "use magic and suffer consequences" or "avoid magic and face danger unprepared" choices. Ryn using demonic abilities leaves traces Ash could read, increasing exposure risk. Death of colleagues/allies is permanent—no resurrection escape hatch. Technology becomes a Veil threat: smartphones documenting supernatural incidents create exposure crises. Material components create strategic gaps: facing an unknown entity means not knowing what defenses work.

## Time & Deadlines

**Core Constraints:**

- **The Vanishing has accelerated over six months**: Frequency and boldness increasing. Pattern suggests the threat will escalate to catastrophic levels soon—characters are racing against an invisible countdown
- **The Veil's deterioration is exponential**: Human breakthrough incidents are increasing in frequency. No one knows how much time remains before complete failure, but all indicators point to "soon, not decades"
- **Enforcer burnout averages five years**: Most operatives don't last longer due to physical danger, political exhaustion, and emotional toll. Ash has been an Enforcer for seven years—they're running on fumes and stubbornness
- **Political faction conflicts are reaching breaking point**: One significant incident (high-profile murder, territorial violation, broken treaty) will ignite violence. The window for preventing supernatural civil war is closing
- **Magical corruption accumulates faster than it heals**: Physical and emotional trauma from repeated magical exposure or combat doesn't fully recover between incidents. Characters are getting progressively more damaged as the story continues

**Plotting Implications:**

The investigation has a built-in deadline (Vanishing will escalate to community-destroying crisis if not solved). Veil deterioration creates urgency around maintaining secrecy—one viral video could unravel centuries of concealment. Ash's burnout means they're one bad day from breaking; the investigation is happening at their worst possible moment. Faction tensions mean any misstep could trigger war, adding "prevent political collapse" to the protagonists' problems. Accumulated trauma means characters get weaker as threats get stronger—exhaustion and injury build rather than reset.

---

## Information & Communication Barriers

**Core Constraints:**

- **The Veil creates perceptual filters on humans**: Mundane minds automatically rationalize away magic, edit out impossible events, dismiss supernatural explanations. Characters cannot simply "show" humans proof—the Veil makes them forget or reinterpret evidence
- **Memory alteration is unreliable**: Magical memory tampering works imperfectly, often leaves gaps or inconsistencies, and is ethically dubious enough that most practitioners avoid it. Characters facing human witnesses cannot cleanly erase problematic knowledge
- **Magical communication is traceable**: Scrying, telepathy, and other supernatural communication methods leave magical signatures that can be detected, tracked, and intercepted. Private supernatural conversations aren't truly private
- **Digital encryption vs. magical scrying trade-off**: Technology blocks magical eavesdropping but creates digital evidence. Magic blocks tech surveillance but leaves mystical traces. Characters cannot achieve perfect communication security
- **The Archive's knowledge is gatekept**: Critical historical information exists but is locked behind archivist approval and payment. Characters cannot independently research—they must negotiate with gatekeepers who have their own agendas
- **Factional information silos**: Vampire covens, shifter packs, witch circles, and fae courts maintain separate intelligence networks. Cross-factional information sharing is rare and politically fraught. Characters aligned with one faction cannot easily access another's knowledge base

**Plotting Implications:**

Human witnesses to supernatural events create cascading problems (can't reliably erase their memories, can't trust the Veil to hide everything, can't eliminate them without becoming murderers). Investigating the Vanishing means piecing together information from hostile, non-communicating factions. Every supernatural communication risks interception—planning in secret is nearly impossible. The Archive gatekeeping means Ryn and Ash might know critical information exists but be unable to access it without unacceptable costs. Technology/magic surveillance trade-off means characters must choose which type of eavesdropping they're vulnerable to.

## Power Structures & Authority

**Core Constraints:**

- **The Covenant Council is paralyzed by politics**: Self-serving, glacially slow to act, prioritizes factional advantage over community welfare. Cannot be relied upon for timely decisions or support
- **Enforcers have autonomy but no backup**: Operate independently with minimal oversight, which means freedom of action but zero institutional support when things go wrong. Success means you handled a crisis alone; failure means you're a convenient scapegoat
- **Real power lies with individuals, not institutions**: Those who command respect, fear, or essential resources hold actual authority. Official positions mean little. Characters must navigate personal power networks rather than institutional hierarchies
- **Sanctuary is protective imprisonment**: Covenant safe houses offer physical security but total isolation. Characters placed in Sanctuary lose agency, contacts, and freedom of movement until the threat is resolved—which might be never
- **Covenant protocols for Veil breaches are extreme**: Exposure risks bring mandatory responses. Enforcers are expected to memory-wipe, recruit, contain, or eliminate human witnesses—no middle ground exists
- **Mixed heritage and past mistakes create permanent political liability**: Characters like Ryn (demon-blooded) or Ash (betrayal survivor) are institutionally vulnerable. They have minimal political protection and are first to be scapegoated when things go wrong
- **Authority figures can detain, investigate, or reassign operatives without justification**: The Covenant's internal enforcement has wide latitude. Characters can be pulled off cases, confined, or exiled based on political maneuvering rather than actual wrongdoing

**Plotting Implications:**

Ash and Ryn cannot appeal to the Council for help—bureaucracy will kill them before it acts. Every Covenant interaction carries risk: superiors might reassign them, confine them to Sanctuary, or make them scapegoats for the Vanishing. Ryn's demon heritage means automatic suspicion from authority; exposure could trigger Covenant containment/elimination protocols. Ash's past makes them politically expendable—one mistake and they lose their position. Real solutions require forming personal alliances with powerful individuals (who will demand favors in return), not working through official channels. Human witnesses force Ash into morally impossible positions: follow protocol (harm innocents) or refuse (become Covenant target).

## Vibes Parameters

**Aesthetic/Tonal Mode:** Urban Fantasy Noir with Romantic Levity

**Core Constraints:**

- **Magic is atmospheric, not mechanical**: Supernatural elements feel instinctive and alive rather than codified. Characters cannot solve problems through "magic system mastery" or rules-lawyering—magic responds to will, emotion, and prices paid, not technical expertise
- **The hidden world operates "in the spaces between"**: Supernatural activity happens in back rooms, abandoned infrastructure, liminal spaces. Magic doesn't replace mundane reality; it hides within it. Characters cannot escape into fully magical environments—they're always navigating dual existence
- **Bantery tone requires emotional deflection through wit**: Even in danger, characters use humor and sarcasm as armor. Scenes cannot be unrelentingly grim—the protagonists must maintain sharp, playful dialogue that lightens tension while revealing character
- **Romance escalates through danger before emotional trust**: Physical attraction and chemistry develop faster than emotional intimacy. Characters cannot have "safe, comfortable" relationship progression—proximity through threat forces connection before they're emotionally ready
- **Visceral sensory detail grounds the wonder**: Magic smells like ozone and copper, happens in gritty urban spaces, feels both wondrous and practical. Scenes cannot be abstractly fantastical—supernatural elements must have texture, smell, physical presence
- **Secrets are currency, exposure is violence**: In a world where everyone hides something, revelation feels like an attack. Characters cannot casually "come clean"—truth-telling must be dramatic, forced, and devastating
- **Found family over biological bonds**: The genre demands chosen family formation. Characters cannot find belonging through blood relationships or institutional loyalty—connection comes from shared danger and mutual choice

**Plotting Implications:**

Soft magic means Ryn cannot precisely calculate their demonic abilities' limits—power usage is risky and unpredictable, preventing "I'll just use X spell to solve Y problem" plotting. Characters must maintain banter even during action sequences, which means they're never fully overwhelmed (tonal constraint that prevents grimdark spiral). Romance beats must happen in dangerous contexts—quiet domestic scenes are genre-inappropriate until after the crisis. Sensory grounding means magical scenes require rich physical detail, slowing pacing during supernatural encounters. The secrets-as-violence rule makes Ryn's revelation structurally necessary as a climactic betrayal moment—confession cannot be gentle or safe. Found family formation means supporting characters (Warren contacts, fellow Enforcers, unexpected allies) must be woven throughout, creating relationship stakes beyond the romantic arc.

---

## Constraint Interactions

**Compounding Pressure Points:**

The Veil's deterioration + technology detecting magic creates a ticking bomb: every supernatural incident risks viral exposure, and the Covenant's dysfunctional response means protagonists must solve this alone while racing against discovery. Information economy + Enforcer under-resourcing means investigation requires trading secrets and accumulating debts to access Archive records or faction intelligence, making the protagonists increasingly politically vulnerable while pursuing the case. Ryn's demon heritage (factional liability) + Ash's past betrayal (political expendability) + Sanctuary's protective imprisonment means if their investigation attracts wrong attention, the Covenant could confine them "for their protection" at the exact moment they need freedom of movement to stop the Vanishing.

Magic's cost + accumulating trauma + no backup means every supernatural confrontation weakens the protagonists while the threat escalates. They cannot sustain a war of attrition—must solve the crisis quickly or be destroyed by accumulated damage. The secrets-as-violence cultural norm + information as currency + mandatory Veil maintenance creates a triple-bind: Ryn must hide their nature (cultural survival), but hiding prevents genuine intimacy (romantic stakes), and revelation could trigger Covenant protocols (political danger). Every relationship milestone increases all three pressures simultaneously.

## Critical "No-Go" Solutions

**Characters CANNOT solve core problems through these paths:**

1. **Cannot call for Covenant institutional backup** because the Council is paralyzed by politics and Enforcers receive no meaningful support. By the time bureaucracy acts, the crisis will have escalated beyond containment. Protagonists are structurally on their own.

2. **Cannot use magic to fix emotional problems** because supernatural power cannot override free will cleanly, cannot resurrect the dead, and cannot erase trauma without breaking something fundamental. Ash's guilt and Ryn's identity crisis have no magical solutions—growth must be psychological, not supernatural.

3. **Cannot prevent Ryn's revelation through better lying** because magic leaves traces, investigation deepens exposure risk, and the NPE's "protective withholding always backfires" rule means continued deception guarantees worse discovery. The secret will explode; only timing is variable.

4. **Cannot solve the Vanishing by recruiting powerful allies** because factional divisions prevent cooperation, information silos mean no faction has complete intelligence, and real power lies with individuals who will demand unacceptable prices (likely involving betraying each other or compromising the investigation).

5. **Cannot simply eliminate human witnesses** because: (1) Ash's hard boundary against murder, (2) Covenant protocols are unreliable (memory wipes don't always work, recruitment is risky, containment is imprisonment), (3) killing innocents would destroy Ash morally and trigger the protagonist's protective instincts, creating relationship rupture before the demon revelation even happens.

6. **Cannot wait for the Veil deterioration or Vanishing to resolve naturally** because both crises are exponentially escalating. Inaction guarantees catastrophic exposure (Veil failure) and supernatural community destruction (Vanishing reaching critical mass). The time pressure is real and cannot be avoided through passivity.

7. **Cannot solve factional conflicts through Covenant authority** because real power operates outside official channels. The Council's paralysis means institutional solutions are structurally impossible—only personal alliances (with associated costs and betrayals) can navigate factional politics.
