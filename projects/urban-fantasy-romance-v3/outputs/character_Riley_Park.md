**Template Version:** Secondary Character Template v1.0

**Story Role:** Mara's best friend, emotional grounding, represents the cost of secrecy

---

## 1. CHARACTER CORE

**Name:** Riley Park
**Role in Story:** Mara's college roommate turned lifelong best friend; social worker who represents Mara's connection to the mundane world

**Primary Function:** Creates ethical conflict by forcing Mara to lie to her closest friend; provides emotional grounding and contrast to supernatural intensity; potential danger point if caught in crossfire

**Core Contradiction:** Believes everyone deserves honesty and connection, but her refusal to accept boundaries sometimes violates the very trust she's trying to protect

**Central Motivation:** To keep Mara from self-isolating; to be the person who shows up no matter what

---

## 2. KEY TRAITS & BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS

**Defining Traits:**
1. **Relentlessly Optimistic** - Sees the good in everyone; refuses to accept that situations are hopeless
2. **Empathetically Invasive** - Reads people's emotions accurately but pushes for disclosure even when they need space
3. **Fiercely Loyal** - Shows up at 2am; remembers every important detail; never gives up on people she loves
4. **Chatty Deflector** - Fills silences with warmth; uses conversation to smooth over tension
5. **Sharp Observer** - Knows all Mara's tells; can spot lies even if she doesn't know the truth

**Fatal Flaw:** Cannot accept that some people need emotional space; interprets boundaries as rejection, which drives her to push harder

**Signature Behaviors:**
- Brings coffee/food as excuse to check in ("I was in the neighborhood...")
- Asks invasive questions disguised as caring ("You seem tired, babe—are you sleeping? Eating? When's the last time you went on a date?")
- Touches during conversation (hand on arm, shoulder squeeze) to maintain connection
- Texts in rapid-fire bursts when worried; shows up in person if ignored

## 3. VOICE & EXPRESSION

**Dialogue Patterns:**
- Warm, runs sentences together without pause
- Uses endearments reflexively ("babe," "honey," "love")
- Asks multiple questions in one breath
- Gentle deflection through subject changes (less barbed than Mara's sarcasm)

**Sample Dialogue:**

*Normal/Caring:*
> "Okay, so I know you said you're fine, but you've cancelled three times this month and you look like you haven't slept since Tuesday, so I brought Thai food and I'm not leaving until you tell me what's actually going on, babe."

*Hurt/Confrontational:*
> "You're lying to me. I don't know about what, but I know you, Mara, and you've never lied to me before. So either tell me the truth or tell me why you can't—but don't insult me by pretending everything's fine."

*Optimistic/Encouraging:*
> "I'm just saying, maybe this Kieran guy isn't a red flag parade. Maybe he's exactly what he seems—someone who actually sees you. Wild concept, I know, but stranger things have happened. Like you voluntarily going to a party."

**Key Emotional Expression:**

**WORRY (about Mara):**
- Physical: Eyebrows knit together, leans forward into Mara's space, fidgets with phone
- Verbal: Rapid-fire questions, uses pet names more frequently, voice goes softer
- Behavioral: Shows up unannounced, brings comfort items, refuses to leave until satisfied

**HURT (when lied to):**
- Physical: Goes very still (contrast to usual animation), arms crossed, voice flat
- Verbal: Short sentences, no endearments, direct confrontation
- Behavioral: Withdraws physically, stops initiating contact, waits for Mara to come to her

## 4. ARC STATES

**V1 - BLISSFUL IGNORANCE (Act 1)**

*Internal State:* Senses Mara pulling away but assumes it's emotional avoidance (Mara's usual pattern). Worried but not yet hurt.

*External Behavior:* Increases check-ins, brings food, asks probing questions about "mysterious new boyfriend." Cheerful but persistent.

*Key Limitation:* Doesn't know supernatural world exists; interprets Mara's secrecy as emotional guardedness, not literal impossibility of disclosure.

**V2 - WOUNDED TRUST (Act 2)**

*Internal State:* Realizes Mara is actively lying (not just deflecting). Feels betrayed that her best friend won't trust her with the truth. Questions the foundation of their friendship.

*External Behavior:* Pulls back for first time in their relationship. Stops initiating contact. When they do interact, she's cooler, more distant—waiting for Mara to come clean.

*Transformation Trigger:* Confrontation scene where Riley directly asks "Why can't you trust me?" and Mara can't answer without violating Veil rules.

**V3 - EARNED UNDERSTANDING (Act 3/Resolution)**

*Internal State:* Accidentally discovers supernatural world (likely by being endangered in climax). Faces choice: accept memory wipe or keep the secret. Realizes Mara wasn't choosing distance—she was protecting Riley.

*External Behavior:* Chooses to keep the secret, proving she can respect boundaries when stakes are real. Relationship rebuilds on new foundation: mutual trust that includes respecting what can't be shared.

*Final Transformation:* Learns that love sometimes means accepting partial truths; that protection can look like secrecy; that trust includes respecting boundaries.

## 5. RELATIONSHIPS & FUNCTION

**Relationship with Mara Chen:**
- Knows all Mara's tells and behavioral patterns
- Provides emotional grounding and mundane perspective
- Creates safe space for Mara to be vulnerable (when Mara allows it)
- Dynamic: Riley pushes for connection; Mara deflects with sarcasm; both care deeply but show it differently

**Plot Function:**
- **Ethical Conflict Generator:** Forces Mara to lie to her closest friend for first time, highlighting cost of living between worlds
- **Tension Escalator:** As supernatural danger increases, keeping Riley safe while keeping secrets becomes increasingly difficult
- **Emotional Breather:** Scenes with Riley reconnect Mara (and readers) to normal life, providing contrast to supernatural intensity
- **Stakes Amplifier:** If Riley gets caught in supernatural crossfire, danger becomes deeply personal
- **Outside Perspective:** Offers unbiased view of Mara's relationship with Kieran once they meet

**Thematic Function:**
- Embodies theme of "rules that protect become rules that imprison" (Veil secrecy protects but isolates)
- Tests secondary theme of identity: Is Mara still herself if she can't be honest with her best friend?
- Represents cost of destiny: bond magic may be fate, but living with it requires sacrificing mundane connections

---

**NPE Compliance Notes:**
- Riley's behavior stems from psychological wound: family avoided difficult emotions, so she learned to force connection to prevent distance
- Arc triggered by plot events: Mara's increasing lies → confrontation → accidental discovery
- Flaw (boundary-pushing) creates consequences: drives wedge in friendship during Act 2
- Voice distinct from Mara: warmer, less barbed, uses endearments vs. sarcasm
- Decisions based on what she knows: interprets secrecy as emotional avoidance until learns truth
