### Protagonist(s)
- Who is the main character(s)?
- What do they want?
- What's broken or incomplete about them?
- What makes them compelling?

### Antagonist(s) / Opposition
- Who or what opposes the protagonist?
- What do they want?
- Why are they a worthy opponent?
- Are they a villain, rival, or force of nature?

### Key Supporting Characters
- Who else matters to this story?
- What roles do they play (mentor, ally, foil, love interest, etc.)?
- How do they complicate or support the protagonist's journey?

### Character Dynamics
- What's the primary relationship tension?
- Who has power over whom?
- What alliances or conflicts exist?

### Overall Character Energy

- Are characters psychologically complex or archetypal?
- What kind of character voices are you going for?

**Instructions**: Replace the content above with your actual characters concept. Focus on the big picture and relationships—the detailed character development happens in Step 3.

**Note**: This is different from `input/character-concept.md` (singular), which is used in Step 3 for detailed character development with the format "# CHARACTER: Name".
