## Example Format

```markdown
# Character: [Name]

[Name] is the protagonist, a 32-year-old former detective turned private investigator.
She has a sharp, analytical mind and can read people instantly, but this same skill
makes her cynical and isolated - she assumes everyone is hiding something because,
in her experience, they usually are.

She grew up in a family of con artists, which taught her to spot lies and manipulation
from an early age. This made her excellent at detective work but terrible at trusting
anyone. She left the police force after discovering corruption at the highest levels,
losing her idealism in the process.

Strengths: Pattern recognition, interrogation, research, staying calm under pressure.
Weaknesses: Paranoid, pushes people away, struggles to ask for help, drinks too much
when stressed. Can't accept that some people are genuinely good.
