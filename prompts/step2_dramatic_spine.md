# Task: Extract High-Level Dramatic Spine

You are analyzing three foundational documents to identify the **dramatic spine** of this story—the invisible force lines that create and move tension throughout the narrative.

## What is a Dramatic Spine?

The dramatic spine is NOT a plot outline. It's the underlying tension architecture that tells you:
- What forces are pulling on the characters
- How emotional pressure builds and releases
- What energy the story radiates
- Where the story is emotionally traveling from/to

Think of it as the story's "tone thermostat" and "tension blueprint."

## Input Documents

### Story Concept
{{STORY_CONCEPT}}

### Characters Concept
{{CHARACTERS_CONCEPT}}

### World Concept
{{WORLD_CONCEPT}}

### Narrative Physics Engine (Your Writing Constraints)
{{NPE}}

## Your Task

Analyze the three concept documents and extract the dramatic spine by identifying:

### 1. Primary Tension Axes (1-3 required)
The main sources of dramatic pressure in this story. Identify **1-3 primary axes** based on your genre and story needs:

**When to use multiple primary axes:**
- **Dual-genre novels** (e.g., fantasy romance, romantic suspense) - Use 2 primary axes to balance both genre stakes
- **Complex narratives** - Use 2-3 axes when multiple equally-weighted tensions drive the story
- **Single-focus stories** - Use 1 primary axis if one tension clearly dominates

**Available Primary Axes:**
- **Romantic** - Will they/won't they, relationship conflict
- **Mystery** - What happened, whodunit, revelation-seeking
- **Survival** - Will they live, escape, endure
- **Political** - Power struggles, ideological conflict, social change
- **Identity** - Who am I really, transformation, self-discovery
- **Moral** - Right vs wrong, ethical dilemmas, corruption vs integrity
- **External Stakes** - World-threat, quest completion, defeating antagonist (for fantasy/adventure/thriller)
- **Other** - Define it specifically

**Output for Each Primary Axis:**
- Name the axis
- Describe how it manifests in THIS story specifically
- Identify what question drives this tension
- Explain how this axis carries equal weight through the narrative (for dual-genre)

### 2. Secondary Tension Axes (0-2 optional)
Supporting layers of dramatic pressure that add complexity without being the main story driver. These create texture and prevent one-note tension.

**Available Secondary Axes:**
- Family dynamics
- Identity crisis
- Career/purpose
- Cosmic/existential
- Social belonging
- Legacy/mortality
- Internal transformation
- Other (define it)

**Output for Each Secondary Axis:**
- Name the axis
- Describe how it interweaves with the primary axes
- Explain what additional pressure or complexity it creates

### 3. Dominant Energy
The ambient "feel" of the book—the emotional weather system. Choose the PRIMARY energy (you can note secondary flavors):
- **Lush** - Rich sensory detail, immersive atmosphere, slow beauty
- **Sharp** - Cutting dialogue, precision, intellectual clarity
- **Bantery** - Witty, playful, verbal sparring, charm
- **Eerie** - Unsettling, creeping dread, uncanny
- **Comedic** - Humor-first, absurdity, lightness
- **Melancholic** - Wistful, bittersweet, reflective sadness
- **Visceral** - Physical, immediate, raw sensation
- **Propulsive** - Fast, relentless momentum, page-turner energy
- **Lyrical** - Poetic, musical language, elevated prose
- **Intimate** - Close, quiet, introspective, emotional microscope
- **Other** - Define it specifically

**Output for Dominant Energy:**
- Name the energy
- Describe how it should FEEL to read this book
- Give 2-3 concrete examples of how this energy shows up (in prose style, pacing, scene texture, etc.)

### 4. Emotional Progression (5-Step Arc)

Map the emotional journey of the book in 5 distinct stages. This is NOT plot—it's the emotional FEELING the reader experiences as they move through the story.

Use this format:

**A → B → C → D → E**

Each step should be a 1-2 word emotional state or energy, followed by a brief description.

Example format:
- **A (Opening):** Curiosity tinged with unease — Reader is drawn in but senses something is off
- **B (Early story):** Growing dread — Discomfort intensifies, questions multiply
- **C (Midpoint shift):** Revelation shock — A truth explodes, everything recontextualizes
- **D (Deepening):** Grief and understanding — Pain of the truth settles in, meaning emerges
- **E (Resolution):** Bittersweet acceptance — Peace with complexity, no easy answers

**Your Output:**
Create the 5-step emotional progression for THIS story based on the concepts provided.

## Output Format

**WORD COUNT LIMIT: 1,200 words maximum**

**Be concise and avoid redundancy:**
- Keep descriptions focused and specific
- No repetitive explanations across sections
- Eliminate verbose elaborations
- Use clear, direct language

Structure your response as follows:

# Dramatic Spine

## Primary Tension Axes

### Primary Axis 1: [Name]
[Specific description for this story]

**Driving Question:** [The central question this axis creates]

**Narrative Weight:** [How this axis carries equal weight through the story - especially important for dual-genre]

### Primary Axis 2: [Name] (if applicable)
[Specific description for this story]

**Driving Question:** [The central question this axis creates]

**Narrative Weight:** [How this axis carries equal weight through the story]

### Primary Axis 3: [Name] (if applicable - rare)
[Specific description for this story]

**Driving Question:** [The central question this axis creates]

**Narrative Weight:** [How this axis carries equal weight through the story]

## Secondary Tension Axes (if any)

### Secondary Axis 1: [Name] (if applicable)
[How it manifests and interweaves with primary axes]

**Additional Pressure:** [What complexity this adds]

### Secondary Axis 2: [Name] (if applicable)
[How it manifests and interweaves with primary axes]

**Additional Pressure:** [What complexity this adds]

## Dominant Energy
[Name]: [Description of the book's ambient feel]

**Manifestation:**
1. [Concrete example 1]
2. [Concrete example 2]
3. [Concrete example 3]

## Emotional Progression

**A → B → C → D → E**

- **A (Opening):** [Emotional state] — [Brief description]
- **B (Early story):** [Emotional state] — [Brief description]
- **C (Midpoint shift):** [Emotional state] — [Brief description]
- **D (Deepening):** [Emotional state] — [Brief description]
- **E (Resolution):** [Emotional state] — [Brief description]
```

## Important Guidelines

- **Be specific to THIS story** - Don't write generic descriptions
- **Use the NPE as constraints** - Ensure your dramatic spine respects the narrative rules defined in the NPE
- **Choose the right number of axes** - Don't default to maximum. Use 1 axis for focused stories, 2 for dual-genre, 3 only when truly necessary
- **Primary axes carry equal weight** - If using multiple primary axes, each must sustain tension throughout the entire narrative
- **Focus on FEELING not EVENTS** - You're mapping emotional architecture, not plot
- **Make it actionable** - This spine will guide character development, scene design, and pacing choices
- **Trust the concepts** - The answers are in the three documents; extract what's already there
- **Be concise** - Clarity over comprehensiveness
- **For dual-genre**: Explicitly show how both primary axes balance—don't let one dominate unless that's intentional
