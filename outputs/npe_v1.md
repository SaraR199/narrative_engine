# NARRATIVE PHYSICS ENGINE v1.0

---

## SECTION 1: CAUSALITY & PLOT LOGIC

### Primary Rules

**1. Plot movement arises from character wounds, misbeliefs, goals, fears, or interpersonal dynamics intersecting with external pressure.**

**2. Major revelations must force characters to reevaluate prior assumptions and make new choices within 1-3 scenes.**

**3. Information discoveries spawn immediate action-forcing consequences. Characters cannot sit passively with new knowledge.**

**4. Evidence that contradicts spoken explanations must create investigative pressure that drives plot forward.**

**5. No event removes major obstacles unless character action directly causes the removal. External salvation is structurally impossible.**

**6. Coincidences only appear when they increase pressure, worsen conflict, or reduce options. They never resolve problems or simplify paths.**

**7. Every irreversible turn emerges from character decision or misjudgment, never from random chance.**

### Secondary Rules

- Short-term relief must be undercut by new complications within the same scene or immediately following scene
- Victory moments cannot stand alone; each must introduce new problems or revelations
- "Protective" withholding of information always creates worse downstream consequences than sharing would have

---

## SECTION 2: CHARACTER ACTION & DECISION PHYSICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Characters make decisions based only on what they know, not what readers know, creating painful dramatic irony.**

**2. Decisions must align with wounds, blind spots, biases, relational tension, and emotional context of the scene.**

**3. Characters with trust wounds default to self-protective choices that sabotage potential connections.**

**4. Vulnerability is terrifying; characters avoid emotional honesty until external pressure forces breaking points.**

**5. Every major decision presents 2-3 plausible alternatives; character chooses the one aligned with their psychology.**

**6. Characters misinterpret events through their emotional wounds, and these misreadings escalate conflict.**

**7. "Protecting" others by withholding truth is a recurring character mistake that always backfires.**

### Secondary Rules

- Characters rarely articulate true motives directly; subtext reveals what dialogue conceals
- Emotional residue from prior scenes carries into subsequent interactions
- Characters believe their harmful choices are justified/necessary in the moment
- Breaking patterns requires external pressure plus internal readiness; one alone never suffices

---

## SECTION 3: DIALOGUE PHYSICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Dialogue must reveal emotion, create tension, or shift relationship dynamics. It cannot simply exchange information.**

**2. Every conversation contains subtext, strategic withholding, or emotional deflection. Surface meaning ≠ actual meaning.**

**3. Characters deflect vulnerability through sarcasm, professionalism, subject changes, or attacking first.**

**4. Key revelations emerge under confrontational pressure, not through willing sharing.**

**5. Lies of omission are as common and consequential as direct lies.**

**6. Characters speak with their cognitive bias and lived experience, never omniscient exposition.**

### Conditional Rules

Use exposition in dialogue only if:
1. The speaker actively tries to persuade, manipulate, justify, or deflect
2. The information changes immediate stakes or available choices
3. The listener's reaction creates new tension

---

## SECTION 4: PACING & TIME MECHANICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Expand time for conflict, danger, intimacy, discovery, betrayal, and emotional devastation.**

**2. Compress time for travel, routine tasks, and recovery periods unless complications arise.**

**3. Every scene must end with consequence that alters options, stakes, emotion, relationships, or power dynamics.**

**4. No breathing room exists between major crises; resolution of one problem immediately introduces the next.**

**5. Physical and emotional trauma accumulates without full recovery between incidents.**

**6. Alternate between tension escalation and brief relief, but relief scenes must introduce new concerns.**

### Transition Rules

**1. Each transition contains directional change in stakes, emotion, goal, location, or information access.**

**2. Off-stage events appear through changed conditions, dialogue fragments, emotional impact, or environmental clues.**

**3. Time jumps require visible consequences of the intervening period affecting character state or situation.**

---

## SECTION 5: POV & EMOTIONAL LOGIC

### Primary Rules

**1. POV is subjective; it misinterprets events, omits details, and focuses on biases shaped by wounds.**

**2. POV must reflect character's emotional state through word choice, sensory focus, and thought patterns—never neutral narration.**

**3. Multiple POVs create dramatic irony; readers know what individual POV characters cannot.**

**4. Show internal conflict through competing thoughts, contradictory impulses, and body betraying conscious intent.**

**5. Physical sensation ties directly to emotional state; emotion manifests as physical experience.**

### Secondary Rules

- POV characters' limited knowledge creates misunderstandings that drive plot forward
- Characters notice environmental details that reflect their emotional preoccupations
- What POV omits is as revealing as what it includes

---

## SECTION 6: INFORMATION ECONOMY

### Primary Rules

**1. Reveal information only when it alters choices, escalates stakes, or damages relationships.**

**2. Characters with knowledge advantage use withholding as power/protection, always creating worse problems.**

**3. Memory loss/gaps serve as extreme information withholding that forces characters to question their entire identity.**

**4. Physical evidence (recordings, documents, scars) can contradict verbal accounts, creating investigative tension.**

**5. Flashbacks/recovered memories provide puzzle pieces that raise new questions, never complete answers.**

**6. Summary/exposition permitted only when dramatization adds no emotional or plot value.**

### Forbidden-by-Constraint

**No information appears unless a character thinks, sees, learns, suspects, remembers, fears, or discovers it within story timeline.**

**Crucial revelations cannot be shared willingly; they must be forced through confrontation, evidence, or crisis.**

---

## SECTION 7: GENRE-ALIGNMENT RULES (Urban Fantasy Romance)

### Required Elements

**1. Supernatural abilities awakening under extreme stress, not conscious control initially.**

**2. Power imbalances between supernatural/human creating consent and agency questions.**

**3. Fated bonds vs. conscious choice creating central romantic tension; destiny ≠ desire.**

**4. Long lifespans/past lives generating tangled histories that complicate present relationships.**

**5. "Protective" manipulation (memory alteration, information control) presented as morally complex, not purely evil.**

**6. Hidden supernatural world layered beneath mundane reality; human characters discovering truth face identity crises.**

**7. Romance escalates through physical danger bringing characters together before emotional trust develops.**

**8. Supernatural powers tied to emotional state; loss of control reflects internal conflict.**

### Allowed When Justified

**1. Memory manipulation when it serves as core violation exploring consent/autonomy themes.**

**2. Fated mate bonds when tension exists between supernatural compulsion and conscious choice.**

**3. Immortal characters pursuing mortal lovers when aging/mortality creates urgency and sacrifice.**

**4. Morally gray "protective" lies when consequences ultimately prove them harmful.**

**5. Love triangles when one option represents destiny and other represents conscious defiance.**

### Forbidden-by-Constraint

**Supernatural abilities cannot solve emotional problems; power escalation parallels but never replaces character growth.**

**Fated bonds cannot override character agency; physical attraction ≠ emotional trust or healthy relationship.**

**Memory restoration cannot happen without severe cost; stolen identity must be fought for, not given back easily.**

**"True love conquers all" resolutions blocked; love alone never solves external plot problems.**

---

## SECTION 8: STAKES & PRESSURE SYSTEM

### Primary Rules

**1. Personal stakes (identity, autonomy, relationships) intertwine with world-ending stakes; solving one requires addressing both.**

**2. Time pressure comes from multiple sources simultaneously: mortal aging, supernatural deadlines, accumulating damage.**

**3. Each potential ally carries risk of being compromised, controlled, or having hidden agenda.**

**4. Physical vulnerability increases as supernatural involvement deepens; knowledge brings danger.**

**5. Characters must choose between protecting different people/values; saving everyone is structurally impossible.**

**6. Stakes escalate through accumulation, not replacement; new problems layer onto existing ones.**

### Secondary Rules

- Trust violations increase isolation, reducing available support when danger peaks
- Characters' attempts to reduce stakes frequently make situations worse
- The cost of inaction must equal or exceed the cost of action

---

## SECTION 9: BETRAYAL & TRUST MECHANICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Trusted allies revealed as threats at moments of maximum vulnerability, when betrayal devastates most.**

**2. Long-term manipulation unveiled in single devastating revelations that recontextualize all prior "support."**

**3. "Protection" used to justify control; paternalistic withholding always presented as care initially.**

**4. Betrayal revelations force characters to question all memories and judgments involving the betrayer.**

**5. Characters who witness others' betrayals begin questioning their own trusted relationships.**

**6. Possession/control reveals that support and manipulation can coexist; victim and tool simultaneously.**

### Secondary Rules

- Small trust violations early in story foreshadow larger betrayals later
- Characters' inability to trust creates self-fulfilling prophecies of abandonment
- Rebuilding trust after betrayal requires structural change, not just apologies
- Final confrontations pit characters against those they trusted most

---

## SECTION 10: REVELATION & RECONTEXTUALIZATION MECHANICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Major revelations must recontextualize at least 3 prior scenes, making readers/characters reinterpret previous events.**

**2. Each answer raises 2+ new questions; complete closure is deferred until climax.**

**3. Characters piece together truth from multiple incomplete sources; no single source provides full picture.**

**4. Physical evidence persists when memory fails; objects/scars tell truths that minds cannot.**

**5. Revelations about identity force characters to question whether their feelings/choices were genuinely theirs.**

**6. The full scope of conspiracy/manipulation revealed in layers; first revelation proves incomplete.**

### Secondary Rules

- Early "explanations" are later revealed as partial truths or outright lies
- Characters' recovered memories conflict with their current identity, creating internal crisis
- Truth-seeking escalates personal danger; ignorance was protective

---

## SECTION 11: SCENE ARCHITECTURE

### Primary Rules

**1. Every scene serves minimum 2 functions: plot advancement + character revelation + relationship shift + information establishment + stakes escalation.**

**2. Scenes end with changed emotional state, new information that demands response, or physical situation that cannot be ignored.**

**3. Characters enter scenes with goals; scenes end with goals complicated, not simply achieved or failed.**

**4. Intimate scenes must advance plot or reveal character wounds; physical connection alone insufficient.**

**5. Confrontation scenes require both parties to have defensible positions based on their limited information.**

### Secondary Rules

- Scene openings establish immediate sensory grounding before backstory/exposition
- Transitions between scenes show consequence of previous scene's ending
- "Safe" scenes become dangerous; "dangerous" scenes reveal emotional vulnerability

---

## EXECUTION NOTES

### Writing Constraints

- NO advice language ("try to," "consider," "should")
- NO vague generalities without measurable application
- ALL rules must be actionable enough for another writer to execute
- Prohibitions stated as functional impossibilities, not negations
- Generic patterns only; no plot-specific character names or events

### Quality Standards

- Another writer could outline/draft in this style using only these rules
- Rules specific enough to enforce, general enough to reuse across stories
- System captures HOW narratives operate, not what they contain
- Balance between constraint (defines boundaries) and possibility (allows creativity)
