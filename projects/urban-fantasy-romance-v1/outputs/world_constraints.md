# World Constraints Document

## Geography & Movement

**Core Constraints:**

- **The Veil creates navigational barriers:** Supernatural spaces are warded to redirect human attention. Characters can't bring mundane allies (like Sarah) to supernatural safe houses without those allies either being recruited, memory-wiped, or magically bound to silence.

- **Marcus is actively hunted:** Guard surveillance covers public transit, airports, major roads, and standard checkpoints. Using normal transportation or appearing in public spaces risks facial recognition or magical detection. Travel requires underground routes, stolen vehicles, or risky supernatural assistance.

- **Territory is factionally controlled:** Seattle's supernatural geography is divided among werewolf packs, fae courts, and vampire houses. Crossing territorial boundaries without permission invites confrontation. Safe houses exist only in neutral zones or through specific alliances.

- **True-Sight makes Kira a visible target:** While glamours don't work on her, her inability to be fooled makes her identifiable to anyone watching for Guard investigators. She can't go undercover in supernatural spaces—she's always recognizable as the True-Seer.

- **The Guard controls infrastructure access:** Guard credentials open supernatural facility doors, bypass wards, and access magical transit. Kira loses this access the moment she's marked as fugitive. Marcus already lost it when he went rogue.

**Plotting Implications:**

Every safe location is temporary and factionally complicated. Characters can't simply "go to ground"—they must negotiate with supernatural factions who have their own agendas, creating plot through forced alliances. Movement itself becomes a tactical problem requiring planning, not freedom.

## Cultural & Social Rules

**Core Constraints:**

- **Guard law is absolute and unforgiving:** Operatives don't harbor fugitives, don't collaborate with accused traitors, don't question chain of command during active investigations. Breaking these rules means immediate termination, possible arrest, and exile from the only community that understands supernatural reality.

- **Probationary status means zero margin for error:** Kira is under extra scrutiny as a new recruit. Any deviation from orders is interpreted as evidence she can't be trusted. Where a senior operative might get questioned, Kira gets investigated.

- **Life-debts are magically enforced, not optional:** Sienna's obligation to Marcus isn't loyalty—it's supernatural contract she physically cannot break. But she retains discretion in HOW she fulfills requests, allowing her to add complications, delays, or incomplete information while technically honoring the debt.

- **Neutrality is social currency in the supernatural underground:** Sienna's speakeasy operates as neutral ground where factions can meet. Taking sides destroys this status and her income. She can provide information to Marcus through the life-debt, but openly declaring against the conspiracy means professional suicide.

- **Social hierarchy among supernatural beings is rigid:** Vampires command respect through age and wealth. Fae courts operate on baroque protocols. Werewolf packs follow alpha authority. Independents have no political voice and are easy to ignore or exploit. Marcus and Kira can't simply "ask for help"—they must navigate complex social hierarchies where they have no standing.

- **Exposure to mundane humans triggers mandatory containment:** Anyone who learns about the supernatural world is recruited into complicity, magically bound to silence, or has memories altered. The Guard tries to avoid memory alteration (difficult magic with side effects) but will use it if necessary. This makes Sarah's investigation increasingly dangerous.

**Plotting Implications:**

Kira can't simply "do the right thing" and still keep her Guard career. Helping Marcus means becoming a fugitive, losing institutional belonging she desperately needs. Social rules prevent easy alliances—every supernatural contact requires negotiation, creates debt, or involves risk. The mundane/supernatural divide means Kira must lie to Sarah or endanger her.

## Resource & Economic Pressures

**Core Constraints:**

- **Marcus has no legitimate income or resources:** Cut off from Guard salary and supernatural factional support, he survives through theft, black market sales, and calling in old favors that are rapidly depleting. Every operation has material cost he can barely afford.

- **True-Seers are irreplaceable strategic assets:** Kira's abilities can't be trained, taught, or transferred. The Guard invested years finding her, recruiting her, and integrating her into operations. Losing her is strategically significant, making her both valuable and a priority target if she defects.

- **Information is Sienna's only tradeable resource:** She controls intelligence about supernatural Seattle, but giving information for free destroys her market position. Even when helping Marcus through the life-debt, she frames aid as transactions to maintain her broker reputation.

- **Kira's career is her only currency:** Her Guard position, Captain Thorne's mentorship, and institutional belonging are the only things she values. Using them to help Marcus means spending her entire psychological bank account. Once gone, she has nothing left.

- **Supernatural safe houses require favors or payment:** No one shelters fugitives from the Guard out of altruism. Every night of sanctuary creates debt—information owed, future favors, or tactical compromises that limit options later.

- **The conspiracy has institutional resources:** Guard facilities, magical artifacts, surveillance networks, personnel, and legal authority. Marcus and Kira are outgunned financially and materially at every turn.

**Plotting Implications:**

Characters can't buy their way out of problems or access resources freely. Every tool costs something—favors that create future obligations, compromises that limit moral high ground, or sacrifices that hurt. Economic pressure makes "just hire help" or "just buy the thing" impossible, forcing character-driven solutions.

## Technology & Magic Limits

**Core Constraints:**

- **Glamours slip under emotional stress or physical trauma:** Supernatural beings maintain glamours through concentration. Pain, fear, rage, or exhaustion causes glamours to flicker or fail. This means high-stress situations (exactly when hiding matters most) are when disguises break.

- **True-Sight is always-on and can't be turned off:** Kira sees through every glamour, every ward, every illusion—constantly. This perceptual overload is exhausting and isolating. She can't choose to see "normally." Training improves her interpretation of what she sees, but doesn't reduce the input.

- **The Veil operates as multi-layered system vulnerable to cascade failure:** Individual glamours + location wards + collective reinforcement + human rationalization all work together. Breaking one layer catastrophically can cause the others to collapse in sequence. This makes the conspiracy's plan genuinely catastrophic—one spectacular magical incident with modern recording technology could shatter all four layers simultaneously.

- **Complex magical artifacts require innate ability:** Marcus (human with no innate magic) can trigger simple enchanted items like Guard detection devices or protective amulets that function like magical batteries. But complex artifacts requiring active magical channeling don't work for him. This limits what he can steal and use.

- **Modern recording technology makes exposure exponentially worse:** Unlike previous eras when witness accounts could be dismissed, smartphones and surveillance cameras create irrefutable evidence. The conspiracy specifically exploits this—a magical incident captured on hundreds of phones and uploaded instantly can't be contained through memory alteration or rationalization.

- **Veil maintenance is collective and vulnerable:** The Veil's strength depends on the supernatural community believing in its necessity. Fractured consensus weakens it. If factions start questioning whether hiding is worth it, the collective reinforcement fails even without forbidden magic attacks.

- **Detection magic works on magical signatures, not intent:** Guard surveillance can track supernatural energy use but can't determine purpose. Marcus using a magical artifact pings the same as any supernatural being using power, making him traceable when he accesses stolen items.

**Plotting Implications:**

Technology and magic don't provide easy solutions—they create constraints. Kira can't turn off her sight when overwhelmed. Glamours fail exactly when characters need them. The conspiracy's plan is structurally sound and genuinely threatening. Marcus can't simply use stolen artifacts to win. Modern tech makes exposure stakes higher than ever before.

## Time & Deadlines

**Core Constraints:**

- **The conspiracy operates on an unknown timeline:** Marcus knows forbidden magic is being weaponized to trigger Veil collapse, but doesn't know the exact schedule. This creates constant pressure—exposure could happen next week or tomorrow.

- **Kira's probationary period is ticking:** She has limited time to prove herself as a Guard investigator before her permanent status is evaluated. Every day she delays capturing Marcus, every unexplained absence, every questionable decision shortens her runway.

- **Trauma accumulates without recovery time:** NPE constraint that physical and emotional damage layers without full healing. Characters get hurt, exhausted, and emotionally devastated across the story without convenient breaks. They're solving problems while injured, grieving, and operating on adrenaline fumes.

- **No breathing room between crises:** Resolving one problem immediately introduces the next complication (NPE rule). Time pressure is relentless—characters never get a safe pause to fully plan, heal, or prepare.

- **Sarah's investigation operates on its own clock:** She's digging into Kira's absences independently. Kira can't control when Sarah will uncover something dangerous, contact the wrong people, or follow her into supernatural danger. Sarah's timeline adds unpredictable urgency.

- **Captain Thorne's patience is finite:** His mentorship provides cover for Kira's irregular behavior, but he's noticing patterns. His growing concern creates a countdown—either Kira produces results that justify his protection, or his patience expires and he becomes an active obstacle.

**Plotting Implications:**

Time is always against the characters. They're racing against multiple simultaneous deadlines (conspiracy, Kira's probation, Sarah's investigation, Thorne's suspicion) while too injured and exhausted to operate at full capacity. No one gets to wait for the "perfect moment"—every decision is made under time pressure with incomplete information.

## Information & Communication Barriers

**Core Constraints:**

- **Kira can't explain the supernatural world to Sarah without triggering containment:** The moment Sarah learns the truth, she becomes subject to Guard protocols: recruitment, magical binding, or memory alteration. Kira explaining to protect Sarah actually triggers the mechanism that endangers her.

- **The stolen artifacts ARE the evidence:** Marcus can't prove the conspiracy without the artifacts he stole. But possessing them marks him as a traitor. He can't show them to authorities (they're part of the conspiracy) and can't destroy them (eliminates proof). He's trapped holding evidence he can't use.

- **True-Sight shows but doesn't explain:** Kira sees through glamours and illusions but must learn to interpret magical signatures. She can see a ward but not know what it does. She can identify a glamoured fae but not their faction or intent. Seeing isn't understanding—which creates investigative friction.

- **The Guard controls the narrative about Marcus:** Official story is he's a thief selling artifacts to the highest bidder. Marcus's actual motive (exposing corruption) is known only to him and the conspirators. Anyone who listens to his version risks being labeled complicit.

- **Chain of command weaponizes information flow:** Kira must report through Captain Thorne, who reports up the chain—where conspiracy members control what gets escalated. Going around him means insubordination. Trusting the process means feeding intelligence to her enemies.

- **Supernatural factions don't share information freely:** Intelligence about conspiracy members, factional movements, or Guard secrets must be traded for, creating information asymmetry. Characters operate with partial knowledge while enemies have institutional intelligence networks.

- **Memory and perception can't be fully trusted:** The possibility of magical manipulation means characters must question whether their memories are real, whether perceptions are accurate. This creates paranoia that limits trust even when warranted.

**Plotting Implications:**

Information flow is structurally compromised. Kira can't get truth without betraying her position. Marcus can't share evidence without increasing his danger. Sarah's investigation operates in ignorance that makes every discovery potentially catastrophic. Characters make decisions with partial information while dramatic irony shows readers the gaps.

## Power Structures & Authority

**Core Constraints:**

- **The Conclave controls Guard policy with factional bias:** Vampires hold disproportionate influence through wealth and political connections. Werewolf packs participate reluctantly. Independents have effectively no representation (seat vacant more often than filled, and when filled the representative lacks political capital). This means Guard priorities reflect vampire interests, not supernatural community needs.

- **The Guard has unchecked enforcement authority:** Can arrest, detain, and judge supernatural beings who break Covenant law. Answers theoretically to the Conclave, but in practice wields independent power through selective law application. This makes Guard corruption structurally devastating—they police everyone but have no meaningful oversight.

- **Captain Thorne controls Kira's career trajectory:** As her direct superior and mentor, he determines assignments, writes evaluations, and shapes her reputation. His approval is required for her advancement. His disappointment could end her career. This gives him enormous leverage that becomes dangerous if he's complicit or manipulated.

- **Kill-on-sight orders override investigation:** Marcus is designated extreme threat, authorized for lethal force without capture attempt. This removes "bring him in for questioning" as an option and makes any Guard operative who encounters him choose between following orders (kill) or defying them (career-ending).

- **Factional politics override justice:** Supernatural factions can apply pressure through Conclave representatives to influence Guard operations. A politically connected vampire can get investigations buried. A powerless independent can be scapegoated. Justice is negotiable based on factional standing.

- **Institutional loyalty is weaponized:** The Guard cultivates "family" identity among operatives to ensure loyalty over external ethics. Questioning the Guard's mission is framed as betraying your brothers and sisters, not as moral independence. This social pressure makes dissent psychologically costly.

**Plotting Implications:**

Authority structures prevent characters from simply "going to the authorities" because the authorities are corrupt or compromised. Kira can't appeal over Thorne's head without destroying her career. Marcus can't surrender and get a fair hearing. Power imbalances mean justice isn't available through proper channels, forcing characters outside the system while being hunted by it.

## Vibes Parameters

**Aesthetic/Tonal Mode:** Urban Fantasy Noir with Propulsive Romance

**Core Constraints:**

- **Banter masks vulnerability, not replaces it:** Characters use sharp verbal sparring and dark humor to deflect genuine emotion, but this creates distance that must be overcome. Emotional honesty only surfaces under extreme pressure—life-or-death situations, confrontations, breaking points. Cozy heart-to-hearts are genre-inappropriate; intimacy emerges through crisis.

- **Physical danger forces emotional proximity:** The romance escalates through forced partnership in high-stakes situations. Quiet domestic scenes are tonal violations. Characters grow closer while running for their lives, not while having coffee. Every intimate moment must be stolen between crises or occur during tactical cooperation.

- **"Protective" manipulation is morally complex, not purely evil:** Characters withhold information, make unilateral decisions, and lie to "protect" others—and the story must show this as harmful while understanding the impulse. Captain Thorne's mentorship, Marcus's secrecy, Kira's lies to Sarah—all presented as care that causes damage, not simple villainy.

- **Noir cynicism prevents easy trust:** The world is corrupt, institutions are compromised, allies have hidden agendas. Characters default to suspicion. Trust is earned slowly through demonstrated action, not granted through attraction or good intentions. Even genuine allies (like Sienna) operate transactionally.

- **No clean victories—every win introduces complications:** Genre expectation is that solving one problem reveals two more. Successful heist means Guard escalates pursuit. Surviving ambush means losing safe house. Emotional breakthrough means new vulnerability. The "bad guys" don't conveniently fail—they're competent and adapt.

- **Propulsive pacing rules out extended introspection:** Characters process trauma through action and terse dialogue, not through paragraphs of internal reflection. Emotional devastation is delivered in gut-punch moments (one perfect line, physical reaction, choice made under pressure), not extended therapy-speak or navel-gazing.

- **Genre expects both romantic chemistry and plot stakes as equal weight:** This isn't a romance with thriller dressing or a thriller with romantic subplot. Both must drive equally. Solving the conspiracy without resolving the romance is structural failure. Resolving the romance without stopping the conspiracy is equally wrong.

**Plotting Implications:**

The vibe dictates scene construction—expand time for verbal sparring, narrow escapes, and high-stakes tactical cooperation. Compress quiet domestic moments or eliminate them entirely. Emotional honesty must be forced through external pressure, never chosen freely. Trust develops through shared danger, not through talking. Every victory must cost something, introduce new problems, or force harder choices.

## Constraint Interactions

The world constraints create compound pressure through intersection. **Information barriers + time pressure** means characters must act on incomplete intelligence before they're ready. **Geographic limits + resource scarcity** forces them into factional territories where they have no leverage, creating political complications. **Power structures + social rules** means institutional channels are closed while institutional authority hunts them—no legal recourse and no safe hiding.

Most devastatingly: **Kira's probationary status + Guard law + Captain Thorne's authority + the kill order on Marcus** creates impossible choice architecture. She can't capture Marcus without killing him (order says lethal force). She can't refuse the assignment without losing her career (probation means zero tolerance). She can't help him without becoming a fugitive (Guard law is absolute). And every day she delays, Thorne's suspicion grows while the conspiracy advances.

The vibe constraints interact with character psychology: **Marcus's trust wounds + noir cynicism + "protective" withholding** means he defaults to isolation exactly when partnership would solve problems. **Kira's desperate need for belonging + institutional loyalty weaponization + banter-as-deflection** means she can't admit doubt even to herself until crisis forces honesty. These psychological patterns worsen practical constraints instead of solving them.

## Critical "No-Go" Solutions

**Characters CANNOT solve problems through these apparently obvious paths:**

1. **Characters CANNOT "call for backup" or "report to higher authorities"** because the conspiracy includes Guard leadership—going through proper channels feeds intelligence to enemies and triggers containment. Marcus tried this and was marked for execution.

2. **Characters CANNOT simply explain the truth to Sarah to get her help** because mundane humans who learn about the supernatural world trigger mandatory Guard containment protocols (recruitment, binding, or memory wipe). Explaining to protect her actually endangers her.

3. **Characters CANNOT wait for "perfect moment" or "better information"** because time pressure from multiple simultaneous deadlines (conspiracy timeline, Kira's probation, Sarah's investigation, Thorne's suspicion) forces action before characters are ready. Waiting means losing.

4. **Characters CANNOT trust institutional allies or factional contacts without verification** because the conspiracy is widespread and supernatural factions pursue self-interest. Every ally might be compromised, working angles, or planning betrayal. Noir cynicism isn't paranoia—it's survival.

5. **Characters CANNOT use complex magic to solve tactical problems** because Marcus lacks innate magical ability (limited to simple enchanted items) and Kira's True-Sight is passive perception, not active power. Magic creates constraints more than solutions.

6. **Characters CANNOT escape Seattle to "start over somewhere safe"** because the Covenant Guard has national reach, Marcus's stolen artifacts are too sensitive to abandon, and the conspiracy's plan threatens the entire supernatural world—running means abandoning innocents to catastrophic Veil collapse and potential human-supernatural war.

7. **Characters CANNOT achieve perfect victory where everyone wins** because the NPE and vibe constraints demand cost. Exposing the conspiracy will hurt innocent Guards who weren't complicit. Reforming the Guard might not be possible—burning it down might be necessary. The romance might require choosing each other over every other loyalty. Someone will be hurt, betrayed, or lost.
