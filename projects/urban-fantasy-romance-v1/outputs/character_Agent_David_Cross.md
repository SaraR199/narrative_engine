# SECONDARY CHARACTER: Agent David Cross

## 1. Character Profile

**Core Identity:** A rule-following investigator who measures his worth through institutional validation and believes merit should triumph over natural advantage.

**Want vs. Need:**
- **Want:** Senior investigator promotion that proves his three years of perfect service outweigh Kira's rare magical gift
- **Need:** To develop independent moral judgment separate from institutional approval and recognize when "following orders" serves corruption

**Core Wound:** Childhood experience of watching less-qualified people succeed through connections/advantages he lacked—father was a low-level bureaucrat who never advanced despite perfect record, taught David that merit eventually wins if you follow every rule perfectly.

**Coping Mechanism:** Rigid adherence to protocol as proof of worthiness. If he does everything by the book, the system must eventually recognize his value. Keeps meticulous records, cites regulations, builds "evidence" of his superiority.

**Fatal Flaw:** Equates institutional approval with moral correctness. Cannot conceive that the system itself might be corrupt—only that individuals within it occasionally fail. This makes him the perfect unwitting tool.

**Worldview:** The Covenant exists to maintain order between human and Fae worlds. Rules exist for good reasons. People who cut corners or get special treatment undermine justice. If the system seems unfair, you haven't proven yourself enough yet.

## 2. Arc Structure (Multi-Path)

**Initial State (All Versions):**
Resentful, competitive, watching Kira for mistakes. Sees her True-Sight as unearned advantage. Files proper reports about her suspicious behavior believing he's protecting the Guard's integrity.

**Version 1 - Antagonist Escalation (If story needs sustained threat):**
- **Resistance:** Kira's secrecy confirms his suspicions. Doubles down on surveillance.
- **Breaking Point:** Discovers Kira working with Marcus. Reports her as traitor.
- **Transformation:** Becomes active pursuer, believing he's saving the Guard from corruption.
- **Final State:** Tragic antagonist who dies or is discredited still believing he was right.

**Version 2 - Tragic Realization (Mid-story revelation):**
- **Resistance:** Escalates reporting when Kira acts stranger. Gets praise from supervisors.
- **Breaking Point:** Discovers his reports went to conspiracy members. He was their surveillance tool.
- **Transformation:** Shattering realization that perfect service served evil.
- **Final State:** Broken idealist who must decide if truth matters more than career.

**Version 3 - Redemption Arc (Late-story ally):**
- **Resistance:** Investigates Kira to prove her guilt, finds evidence of conspiracy instead.
- **Breaking Point:** Forced to choose between reporting truth or protecting his career.
- **Transformation:** Chooses moral correctness over institutional approval.
- **Final State:** Ally who provides inside access but struggles with cost of betraying the Guard.

## 3. Voice & Behavior

**Speech Patterns:**
- Formal, procedural: "According to section 7.3..." "The proper protocol requires..."
- Passive-aggressive in competition: "I'm sure you have good reasons for bypassing procedure."
- Defensive when challenged: "I've been with the Guard for three years. I know policy."
- Uses institutional language as shield: "The Captain's decision" not "I disagree"

**Sample Dialogue:**
"Congratulations on the Vane assignment, Belen. I'm sure Captain Thorne had good reasons for assigning a probationary agent to our highest-priority fugitive. Your True-Sight is certainly... convenient. Just remember that standard surveillance protocols still apply, regardless of natural advantages. We wouldn't want any irregularities in the case file."

**Body Language:**
- Maintains rigid posture (military bearing from Guard training)
- Takes notes during conversations with Kira (subtle intimidation)
- Stands too close when questioning her choices (territorial)
- Straightens files, aligns objects (control behavior under stress)

**Decision-Making Style:** Protocol-first. Consults regulations before acting. Builds documented evidence trails. Prefers official channels over direct confrontation.

**Stress Response:** Becomes more rigid and procedural. Cites more rules. Increases documentation. Seeks validation from superiors.

## 4. Relationship Dynamics

**With Kira:**
- Surface: Professional courtesy masking competition
- Reality: Resentful surveillance, waiting for her to fail
- Evolution: Depends on arc version (escalating threat / broken ally / reluctant helper)
- Dynamic: He sees her rookie mistakes as proof she's unqualified; she sees his rigidity as obstacle

**With Captain Thorne:**
- Seeks approval constantly, doesn't notice Thorne using his reports
- Interprets any acknowledgment as validation of his worth

**With Marcus (if they interact):**
- Would see him as pure criminal, unable to process complexity
- Marcus would pity him as system's perfect victim

**With Conspiracy Members:**
- Unknowingly serves them by reporting Kira's behavior
- They encourage his resentment subtly, never directly ordering surveillance

## 5. NPE Compliance Notes

**Psychology-Driven Actions:**
- Reports Kira because wounded pride makes him interpret her secrecy as proof of unworthiness
- Every antagonistic choice stems from genuine belief he's protecting the Guard
- His rigidity is armor against feeling overlooked/undervalued

**Justified Harmful Choices:**
- Believes surveillance of Kira protects institutional integrity
- Sees reporting her as duty, not betrayal
- Cannot recognize he's being manipulated because that would mean the system failed

**Limited Knowledge Creates Plot:**
- Doesn't know about conspiracy, so interprets Kira's behavior through lens of rivalry
- His reports provide conspiracy with intelligence while he thinks he's doing right thing
- Creates danger for Kira through well-intentioned actions

**Consistent Internal Logic:**
- Would never knowingly serve corruption (too invested in system's righteousness)
- Cannot be easily convinced of conspiracy (would require shattering his worldview)
- Any arc transformation must be earned through undeniable evidence that breaks his faith

## 6. Integration Notes

**Thematic Function:**
- Foil to Kira: Shows path of unquestioning institutional loyalty
- Embodies "well-intentioned people serving corrupt systems"
- Forces question: When does duty become complicity?

**Sympathy Maintenance:**
- His resentment is earned (actually was passed over unfairly from his perspective)
- Genuinely believes in justice and order
- Tragic victim of the system he serves

**Plot Function:**
- Creates professional danger through legitimate channels
- Provides conspiracy with intelligence unknowingly
- Forces Kira to hide evidence, complicating her investigation
- Represents consequences of her choices within Guard structure
