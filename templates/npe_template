# **NARRATIVE PHYSICS ENGINE (NPE) TEMPLATE**

---

## **SECTION 1: CAUSALITY & PLOT LOGIC**

### **Primary Rules (these govern the entire story)**

**1. All plot movement must arise from the characters’ choices, misbeliefs, goals, fears, or interpersonal dynamics.**

**2. Events must have clear setup → event → consequence, even if the setup is subtle.**

**3. No event may remove a major obstacle unless a character takes action that directly causes the removal.
External salvation is structurally impossible.***(This blocks deus ex machina without saying “no.”)*

**4. Coincidences are allowed only when they increase pressure, worsen conflict, or reduce options.
They may never resolve problems or simplify the story’s path.**

**5. Every irreversible turn (“doorway of no return”) must emerge from a character decision or misjudgment.**

---

## **SECTION 2: CHARACTER ACTION & DECISION PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Characters make decisions based only on what they know, not what the reader knows.**

**2. Decisions must align with:**

- personal goals
- wounds
- blind spots
- biases
- relational tension
- the emotional context of the scene

**3. Every major decision must present 2–3 plausible alternatives; the character chooses the one aligned with their psychology.***(This prevents random or stupid decisions.)*

**4. Characters interpret events incorrectly at times, and these misreadings create conflict or escalation.**

### **Secondary Rules**

- Characters rarely articulate their true motives directly.
- Emotional residue from prior scenes must be carried into the next ones.

---

## **SECTION 3: DIALOGUE PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Dialogue must reveal emotion, create tension, or shift relationship dynamics.
It cannot simply restate what the other character said.***(Prevents echolalia.)*

**2. At least one layer of subtext or strategic withholding must appear in every conversation.**

**3. Characters speak with their own cognitive bias and lived experience, not omniscient exposition.**

### **Conditional Rules**

Use exposition in dialogue **only if**:

1. The speaker is actively trying to persuade, manipulate, justify, or deflect.
2. The information changes stakes or choices.

---

## **SECTION 4: PACING & TIME MECHANICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Expand time for conflict, danger, intimacy, discovery, and emotional shifts.**

**2. Compress time for travel, routine tasks, repeated actions, or filler moments.**

**3. Every scene must end with a consequence that alters:**

- options
- stakes
- emotion
- relationships
- power dynamic

**4. Scenes should not remain in the same energy state for too long; alternate between tension and release.**

### **Transition Rules**

**1. Each transition must contain a directional change (stakes, emotion, goal, location, time).**

**2. Off-stage events are permitted only if referenced through:**

- changed conditions
- dialogue fragments
- emotional impact
- environmental clues

---

## **SECTION 5: POV & EMOTIONAL LOGIC**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. POV is subjective; it may misinterpret events, omit details, or focus on sensory biases.**

**2. POV must reflect the character’s emotional state, not neutral narration.**

**3. Show internal conflict through:**

- competing thoughts
- sensory reactions
- contradictory impulses

---

## **SECTION 6: INFORMATION ECONOMY**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Reveal information only when it alters choices, stakes, or relationships.**

**2. Summary/exposition is permitted only when dramatization adds no emotional or plot value.**

**3. Flashbacks are allowed only when they shift present-day stakes.**

### **Forbidden-by-Constraint (Functional Prohibition)**

**No information may appear unless a character thinks, sees, learns, suspects, remembers, fears, or discovers it within the story’s timeline.**

# **SECTION 7: GENRE-ALIGNMENT RULES**

Fill in per novel:

**Required Elements:**
[e.g., slow-burn tension, banter, magical realism logic, etc.]

**Allowed When Justified:**
[e.g., villain monologues only when stalling, prophecy when subverted, etc.]

**Forbidden-by-Constraint:**
[e.g., resurrection unless cost is permanent]
