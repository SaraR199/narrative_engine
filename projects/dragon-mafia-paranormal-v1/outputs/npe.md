# NARRATIVE PHYSICS ENGINE v1.0
## Paranormal Romance / Urban Fantasy Edition

---

## SECTION 1: CAUSALITY & PLOT LOGIC

### Primary Rules

**1. Plot advances through character investigation, confrontation, or consequences of prior deceptions—never coincidence or convenient revelation.**

**2. Supernatural abilities that provide information extract proportional physical or psychological cost. Crucial information demands severe toll.**

**3. Major revelations emerge from:
   - Physical evidence discovered through investigation
   - Character mistakes exposing hidden truths
   - Direct confrontation forcing admission
   - Supernatural experiences leaving verifiable traces**

**4. Deceptions require clear motivations rooted in character wounds, fears, or goals. No withholding information "just because."**

**5. External magical obstacles create internal psychological conflict. Characters cannot simply "break" supernatural constraints—they must navigate around them or pay severe costs.**

**6. Information revealed in one scene generates urgent questions driving the next investigation or confrontation.**

**7. Supernatural solutions cannot resolve emotional conflicts. Magic complicates or reveals, never repairs trust, grief, or broken relationships.**

---

## SECTION 2: CHARACTER ACTION & DECISION PHYSICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Characters decide based on incomplete information filtered through emotional wounds and biases, not objective assessment.**

**2. Characters "protecting" others by withholding information face escalating consequences proving their choice worsened things.**

**3. Major decisions driven by:
   - Desperate need to know truth
   - Attempt to protect from painful knowledge
   - Response to perceived betrayal or abandonment
   - Compulsion from unhealed emotional wound
   - Conflicting loyalties creating impossible choices**

**4. Characters misinterpret events through their psychological lens:
   - Abandoned interpret caution as rejection
   - Obsessed interpret boundaries as temporary obstacles
   - Traumatized interpret normalcy as threat
   - Guilty interpret consequences as punishment**

**5. Choosing between competing loyalties creates immediate negative consequences regardless of selection.**

**6. Characters cannot "choose better" until confronting the wound driving their harmful pattern. Rational awareness alone never changes behavior.**

### Secondary Rules

**1. Investigative protagonists pursue truth even when warned it will destroy them. Need to know overrides survival instinct.**

**2. Characters manipulating "for love" genuinely believe they're protecting the target, never acknowledging autonomy violation until confronted with undeniable proof.**

**3. Supporting characters hold crucial information that could prevent tragedy but withhold it for protective or prudent reasons.**

---

## SECTION 3: DIALOGUE PHYSICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Characters evade direct questions through:
   - Answering different questions
   - Providing technically true but incomplete information
   - Redirecting to emotional/physical intimacy
   - Claiming protective motivations**

**2. Crucial information revealed through:
   - Accidental slips when emotionally compromised (drunk, furious, grief-stricken, lustful)
   - Persistent interrogation cornering the liar
   - Mistakes revealing knowledge they shouldn't possess
   - Third-party witnesses providing contradictory information**

**3. Conversations about withheld truth escalate through:
   - Deflection/charm offensive
   - Partial admission
   - Defensive justification
   - Silence or retreat when cornered
   - Full reveal only under undeniable pressure**

**4. Deepest fears or needs emerge through:
   - What they demand from others
   - What they cannot tolerate losing
   - Lies they tell themselves
   - Actions contradicting stated motivations**

### Conditional Rules

**1. Romantic/sexual dialogue layers physical desire with emotional manipulation, neither character fully honest about vulnerability.**

**2. Interrogation scenes reveal as much about the questioner as the questioned.**

**3. Exposition through dialogue must be:
   - Actively resisted by listener who doesn't want it true
   - Incomplete, requiring further investigation
   - Motivated by speaker's need to justify, warn, or manipulate**

---

## SECTION 4: PACING & TIME MECHANICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Expand time for:
   - Physical experiences of supernatural phenomena
   - Confrontations exposing lies
   - Intimate moments interrupted by revelations or threats
   - Investigative discoveries changing protagonist's identity understanding
   - Choices between competing loyalties**

**2. Compress time for:
   - Travel between locations
   - Routine investigation yielding no emotional stakes
   - Explanations of supernatural systems
   - Recovery periods between crisis points**

**3. Chapter endings shift:
   - Revelation recontextualizing prior events
   - Betrayal or trust violation
   - External threat escalation
   - Character isolation
   - Discovery of evidence contradicting established "truth"**

**4. POV switches occur at maximum dramatic irony moments:
   - Reader learns antagonist's true motivation after protagonist makes wrong assumption
   - Reader sees betrayer's perspective after protagonist extends trust
   - Reader discovers hidden connection after protagonist dismisses possibility**

### Transition Rules

**1. Scene transitions carry emotional residue. Characters enter new scenes processing previous trauma, grief, or revelation—never reset to neutral.**

**2. Time jumps marked by:
   - Changed physical conditions
   - References to off-stage actions through evidence
   - Dialogue fragments referencing the gap
   - Shifted power dynamics**

---

## SECTION 5: POV & EMOTIONAL LOGIC

### Primary Rules

**1. Each POV colored by character's emotional wound:
   - Abandoned filter through rejection and worthlessness
   - Obsessed filter through destiny and ownership
   - Guilty filter through debt and punishment
   - Traumatized filter through threat and survival**

**2. POV character's internal narration contradicts external behavior when:
   - Manipulating "for their own good"
   - Hiding pain behind competence or charm
   - Denying desperate needs
   - Rationalizing harmful choices through noble motivations**

**3. Physical sensations convey emotional states:
   - Unwanted attraction = body betraying rational mind
   - Supernatural connection = invasive physical compulsion
   - Memory recovery = violent physical trauma
   - Lies/deception detected = visceral wrongness**

**4. Characters experience conflicting simultaneous emotions without resolution:
   - Love and rage toward same person
   - Desperate need for truth and terror of learning it
   - Physical desire and emotional revulsion
   - Gratitude and resentment for protection/interference**

### Secondary Rules

**1. Investigator POVs show:
   - Cataloging evidence during emotional crisis
   - Professional instincts competing with personal feelings
   - Guilt over objectivity failing when case becomes personal
   - Pattern recognition bypassing conscious thought**

**2. Supernatural POVs show:
   - Casual acceptance of impossible as normal
   - Centuries creating different emotional scale
   - Predatory instincts conflicting with chosen ethics
   - Power as default solution requiring conscious restraint**

**3. Possessed/influenced POVs show:
   - Time loss and disorientation
   - Actions performed with skills they don't consciously possess
   - Fragmented awareness of compulsion
   - Post-influence horror**

---

## SECTION 6: INFORMATION ECONOMY

### Primary Rules

**1. Supernatural revelations arrive through investigating physical evidence, never explanatory conversation unless:
   - Explainer is lying or providing incomplete information
   - Listener actively resists/challenges
   - Explanation creates new urgent questions**

**2. Memory recovery must be:
   - Triggered by physical objects, locations, or sensory experiences
   - Fragmentary and incomplete
   - Violently traumatic, deterring repeated attempts
   - Contradictory to protagonist's assumed identity**

**3. Each character holds specific truth pieces hidden for different reasons:
   - Antagonist hides methods and full plan
   - Love interest hides prior knowledge of protagonist's past
   - Ally hides information they think would break protagonist
   - Protagonist's mind hides memories threatening survival**

**4. Lies revealed through:
   - Liar possessing impossible knowledge
   - Physical evidence contradicting stated facts
   - Third party providing different version
   - Behavior inconsistent with claimed ignorance**

**5. No information revealed through:
   - Overheard conversations intended to inform reader
   - Antagonist monologuing their plan
   - Convenient prophesy showing exactly what to do
   - Character "remembering" crucial detail at perfect moment**

### Forbidden-by-Constraint

**No character learns crucial information without:
   - Actively investigating despite warnings
   - Paying severe physical or psychological cost
   - Confronting someone with reason to withhold it
   - Discovering physical evidence proving truth**

## SECTION 8: STAKES & PRESSURE SYSTEM

### Primary Rules

**1. Personal stakes parallel external stakes:
   - Solving murder mystery = recovering lost identity
   - Preventing apocalypse = reclaiming stolen agency
   - Protecting innocents = forgiving self for past failures
   - Destroying corrupt system = choosing authentic self over false destiny**

**2. Stakes escalate through loss of safety:**

   - **Stage 2:** Safe spaces violated
   - **Stage 3:** Trusted allies revealed as compromised or hostile
   - **Stage 4:** Protagonist's mind/memories proven unreliable
   - **Stage 5:** Core identity revealed as constructed lie**

**3. Ticking clock has multiple simultaneous countdowns:**
   - External: antagonist eliminating targets
   - Physical: protagonist's body deteriorating from supernatural strain
   - Emotional: relationships fracturing under revealed lies
   - Cosmic: supernatural deadline approaching**

**4. Each revelation forces protagonist to question previous certainty:
   - "I'm losing my mind" → "I have supernatural abilities"
   - "He's helping me" → "He knew truth all along"
   - "She's my only ally" → "She's been controlled by enemy"
   - "I'm the victim" → "I might be the weapon"**

**5. Power escalation creates new vulnerabilities:
   - Gaining abilities = becoming target
   - Learning truth about past = destabilizing present identity
   - Recovering memories = experiencing trauma fresh
   - Accepting magical heritage = losing claim to human life**

### Secondary Rules

**1. No safe harbor remains safe. Each location must be:**
   - Violated by antagonist

   - Abandoned due to protagonist's transformation**

**2. Every alliance tested by:**
   - Revelation of prior deception
   - Conflicting loyalties
   - Moral disagreement about acceptable costs
   - Discovery that ally is compromised**

**3. Antagonist pressure is psychological before physical:**
   - Messages proving they know protagonist's secrets
   - Violations of private space
   - Harm to people protagonist cares about
   - Direct confrontation only after psychological dominance established**

## SECTION 10: REVELATION & RECONTEXTUALIZATION MECHANICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Every major reveal reframes previous scenes:**
   - "Helpful" advice revealed as manipulation
   - "Protective" behavior revealed as possessive control
   - "Coincidental" meetings revealed as stalking/surveillance
   - "Mysterious" reactions revealed as recognition protagonist didn't share**

**2. Protagonist positioned to notice clues but dismiss them through:**
   - Unreliable narrator believing they're mentally ill
   - Trauma-brain prioritizing survival over pattern recognition
   - Emotional investment in believing ally's lies
   - Professional skepticism rejecting supernatural explanations**

**3. Truth worse than protagonist's darkest suspicion:**
   - Not just "he lied" but "he knew everything from the beginning"
   - Not just "she's compromised" but "she's been controlled for months/years"
   - Not just "I have powers" but "I'm the weapon/anchor/prison"

   - Documentation surviving magical interference**

**2. Physical evidence survives magical manipulation:**
   - Photographs retain truth when memory is altered
   - Digital records preserve what glamour changes
   - Scars/wounds contradict claimed timeline
   - Locations contain residue of magical working**

**3. Each revelation creates urgent new question:**
   - "If he lied about this, what else?" → investigates ally
   - "If she's controlled, since when?" → reconstructs timeline
   - "If I'm this, what am I capable of?" → drives self-discovery
   - "If past is false, what is true?" → drives identity quest**
