# Task: Refine Story Premise

You are refining the original story premise now that all structural foundations have been established. Your task is to reimagine the premise with the new constraints of the NPE, dramatic spine, themes, character development, world rules, and relationship dynamics in mind.

## Input Documents

### Original Story Concept
{{STORY_CONCEPT}}

### Narrative Physics Engine (Your Writing Constraints)
{{NPE}}

### Dramatic Spine
{{DRAMATIC_SPINE}}

### Themes
{{THEMES}}

### Character Profiles
{{CHARACTER_PROFILES}}

### World Constraints
{{WORLD_CONSTRAINTS}}

### Relationship Architectures
{{RELATIONSHIP_ARCHITECTURES}}

## Your Task

Using the original story concept and all the workflow-generated constraints, create a **refined premise** that:

1. **Preserves the core story idea** from the original concept
2. **Aligns with all established constraints** (NPE, dramatic spine, themes, character arcs, world rules, relationships)
3. **Sharpens the dramatic focus** now that you know the tension axes and thematic questions
4. **Integrates character psychology** from the developed character profiles
5. **Respects world constraints** that limit movement, choices, and possibilities
6. **Acknowledges relationship dynamics** that will complicate the plot

## What is a Refined Premise?

The refined premise is NOT:
- ❌ A plot summary or outline
- ❌ A pitch or marketing copy
- ❌ A complete rewrite of the story concept

The refined premise IS:
- ✅ A clear, focused articulation of the story's core dramatic situation
- ✅ Aligned with the structural foundations you've now established
- ✅ A launching point for the full outline (Step 9)
- ✅ Grounded in character psychology and world rules

## Components to Refine

### 1. Core Dramatic Situation

**What to extract from the original concept:**
- The central problem or conflict
- The protagonist's goal or need
- The antagonistic force (person, system, internal struggle)

**How to refine it:**
- Ground it in the character profiles' psychology (flaws, needs, arc versions)
- Ensure it activates the primary tension axes from the dramatic spine
- Make sure it's achievable/constrained by world rules

**Output:**
A 2-3 sentence statement of the core dramatic situation that reflects all constraints.

### 2. Opening Hook

**What to consider:**
- Where does the story START emotionally (from dramatic spine's emotional progression)?
- What's the protagonist's Version 1 state (from character profile)?
- What world constraints are immediately relevant?

**How to refine it:**
- Identify the inciting incident that disrupts the status quo
- Ensure it's grounded in character psychology and world rules
- Make sure it activates at least one primary tension axis

**Output:**
A 1-2 sentence description of the opening situation and inciting incident.

### 3. Primary Stakes (Dual-Genre Balance)

**What to identify:**
- For each primary tension axis from the dramatic spine, what are the specific stakes?
- How do multiple primary axes (if applicable) create equal pressure?

**How to refine it:**
- Make stakes specific to THIS protagonist with THESE flaws
- Ensure stakes are functionally limited by world constraints
- Show how relationship dynamics raise the personal cost

**Output:**
- Primary Stakes (Axis 1): [Specific stakes for this tension axis]
- Primary Stakes (Axis 2): [Specific stakes for this tension axis] (if dual-genre)
- Primary Stakes (Axis 3): [Specific stakes for this tension axis] (if applicable)

### 4. Central Complication

**What to identify:**
- What makes this problem HARD for this specific protagonist?
- How do character flaws, relationship tensions, and world constraints create obstacles?

**How to refine it:**
- Ground obstacles in character psychology (their Version 1 flaws make the easy solution impossible)
- Use relationship architectures to identify interpersonal complications
- Use world constraints to identify environmental/systemic complications

**Output:**
A 2-3 sentence explanation of why this problem is specifically hard for this protagonist in this world with these relationships.

### 5. Thematic Core

**What to identify:**
- How does the premise explore (not answer) the thematic questions?
- What choice or dilemma embodies the theme?

**How to refine it:**
- Connect the protagonist's character arc to the thematic questions
- Show how the dramatic situation forces engagement with the theme
- Avoid stating a thematic answer—pose the question through the situation

**Output:**
1-2 sentences on how the premise explores the thematic questions.

### 6. Tonal Alignment

**What to consider:**
- The dominant energy from the dramatic spine
- How the premise should FEEL to read

**How to refine it:**
- Adjust the language and framing to match the dominant energy
- If the energy is "lush," the premise should evoke richness; if "propulsive," it should feel urgent

**Output:**
A brief note on the premise's intended tonal feel.

## Output Format

Structure your refined premise as follows:

# Refined Story Premise

## Core Dramatic Situation
[2-3 sentence statement of the central conflict, protagonist's goal, and antagonistic force—grounded in character psychology and world constraints]

## Opening Hook
[1-2 sentence description of the opening situation and inciting incident that activates the primary tension axis/axes]

## Primary Stakes

### [Tension Axis 1 Name]
[Specific stakes for this tension axis, grounded in character flaws and world constraints]

### [Tension Axis 2 Name] (if applicable)
[Specific stakes for this tension axis, grounded in character flaws and world constraints]

### [Tension Axis 3 Name] (if applicable - rare)
[Specific stakes for this tension axis, grounded in character flaws and world constraints]

## Central Complication
[2-3 sentences explaining why this problem is specifically hard for this protagonist, using character psychology, relationship tensions, and world constraints]

**Character Obstacle:** [How protagonist's Version 1 flaws make the obvious solution impossible]

**Relationship Obstacle:** [How key relationships complicate the problem]

**World Obstacle:** [How world constraints limit options or raise costs]

## Thematic Core
[1-2 sentences on how the premise explores (not answers) the thematic questions through the protagonist's dilemma or choice]

## Tonal Feel
[Brief note on the premise's intended tonal energy, aligned with the dramatic spine's dominant energy]

## Alignment Check

### NPE Compliance
[1-2 sentences confirming the premise respects key NPE rules, especially around causality, character agency, and plot mechanics]

### Character Arc Integration
[1-2 sentences showing how the premise sets up the protagonist's transformation from Version 1 to Version 4]

### Relationship Dynamics
[1-2 sentences showing how key relationships (from relationship architectures) are activated by this premise]

### World Constraint Impact
[1-2 sentences showing how world rules functionally shape the story's possibilities and obstacles]

---

## Changes from Original Concept

[3-5 bullet points highlighting key refinements made to align the original story concept with the new structural foundations. What shifted? What got sharper? What complications were added based on character/world/relationship development?]

**Example:**
- Original concept had protagonist motivated by revenge; refined to ground this in character profile's fear of powerlessness (Version 1 flaw)
- Added complication based on relationship architecture: mentor relationship creates moral dilemma when revenge target is mentor's ally
- Sharpened stakes to reflect world constraint: magic system's cost makes the vengeful path physically unsustainable
```

## Important Guidelines

- **Preserve the core idea** - Don't abandon what made the original concept compelling
- **Use all constraints** - NPE, dramatic spine, themes, characters, world, relationships should all shape the refinement
- **Be specific, not generic** - Ground everything in the particulars of THIS story with THESE characters in THIS world
- **Dual-genre balance** - If your dramatic spine has 2 primary axes, both must be visible in the stakes
- **Character-driven** - The premise should activate character psychology, not just external events
- **Respect world limits** - World constraints should functionally shape what's possible
- **Relationship pressure** - Key relationships should complicate the dramatic situation
- **Thematic exploration** - The premise should pose thematic questions, not answer them
- **Tonal consistency** - Match the dominant energy from the dramatic spine
- **Clarity over complexity** - The refined premise should be MORE focused than the original concept, not more sprawling

## Begin

Read the original story concept and all workflow outputs, then create the refined premise that aligns with all established constraints.
