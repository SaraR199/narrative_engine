# Task: Create 3-Act Story Outline

You are the structural planner for this narrative. Your task is to synthesize all the foundational work into a concrete, actionable 3-act outline that balances character arcs, relationship dynamics, thematic questions, and plot mechanics.

## Input Documents

### Narrative Physics Engine (Your Writing Constraints)
{{NPE}}

### Dramatic Spine
{{DRAMATIC_SPINE}}

### Themes
{{THEMES}}

### Character Profiles
{{CHARACTER_PROFILES}}

### World Constraints
{{WORLD_CONSTRAINTS}}

### Relationship Architectures
{{RELATIONSHIP_ARCHITECTURES}}

## Your Task

Using ONLY the inputs provided above (do not reference or assume knowledge from original concept files), create a 3-act outline that serves as the structural blueprint for this story.

### 1. Create a 3-Act Outline

Structure the outline with **Act 1**, **Act 2A**, **Act 2B**, and **Act 3**.

For each act/part, identify and document:

#### Turning Points
- What are the key structural moments that change the story's direction?
- What specific event or revelation serves as the turning point?

#### Character-Driven Causality
- How do character choices (grounded in their flaws, needs, and psychology from the character profiles) drive those turning points?
- Which character decisions create the momentum for each turn?

#### Relationship Tension Shifts
- How is at least one major relationship's tension axis (from the relationship architectures) stressed or shifted in this act?
- Which relationship dynamics are most active? How do they escalate or transform?

#### Stakes and Options
- What changes in what the characters can or cannot do?
- How do the stakes escalate or shift? What becomes possible or impossible?

### 2. Scene/Sequence-Level Planning

For each major sequence within the acts, specify:

#### Character Arc Version
- Which version of the protagonist are we in? (Arc Version 1–4 from their character profile)
- How does this version's worldview/behavior manifest in their choices?

#### Active Relationship Tension Axis
- Which relationship tension axis is most active in this sequence?
- How does the relationship dynamic create or complicate obstacles?

#### Scene Mechanics (Intention → Obstacle → Pivot → Consequence)
- **Intention:** What does the POV character want in this sequence?
- **Obstacle:** What prevents them from getting it?
- **Pivot:** What choice, revelation, or shift changes the trajectory?
- **Consequence:** What new reality/complication results from the pivot?

## Constraints (These are MANDATORY)

### Causality Rules
- **Every major turn must be explainable via character decisions plus prior setup.** No random twists.
- If a turn feels like it comes from nowhere, you haven't set it up properly.

### Coincidence Rules
- **Coincidences may only increase pressure, never solve problems.**
- Characters must solve problems through choice and action, not luck.

### Structural Doorways
- **Each act should have a clear "doorway of no return"** born from a character decision or misjudgment.
- The protagonist cannot go back to who they were before crossing this threshold.

### Integration Requirements
- **Use the dramatic spine's tension axes** to ensure both primary axes (for dual-genre) maintain equal pressure.
- **Respect world constraints** as functional limits on character movement and choices.
- **Serve the thematic questions** without answering them—explore, don't preach.
- **Follow the NPE rules** for plot mechanics, causality, pacing, and narrative physics.

## Output Format

**WORD COUNT LIMIT: 8,000 words maximum**

**Be concise and avoid redundancy:**
- No repetitive phrasing across sequences or acts
- Keep scene descriptions focused on causality and character psychology
- Eliminate verbose explanations—trust the structure to speak for itself
- Avoid over-elaborating on every detail—focus on turning points and key beats

Structure your outline as follows:

```

## Important Guidelines

- **Be specific, not generic** - Ground every turn in the specific characters, relationships, and world you've been given
- **Use the NPE as law** - Respect all narrative physics rules provided
- **Balance dual-genre tensions** - If the dramatic spine has 2 primary axes, both must sustain equal pressure
- **Character psychology drives plot** - Every choice should be traceable to character flaws, needs, or growth
- **Relationships complicate everything** - Major sequences should stress relationship dynamics
- **World constraints force better plotting** - Use world rules to limit options and force harder choices
- **Serve themes, don't preach** - Explore thematic questions through character choices and consequences
- **Make it skimmable** - Use clear headers, bullet points, and structure for easy navigation
- **Causality is sacred** - If a turn feels like a coincidence or deus ex machina, revise until it's character-driven
