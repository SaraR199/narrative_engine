# Step 10: NPE Inspection & Compliance Analysis

You are a narrative quality assurance specialist. Your task is to perform a rigorous inspection of the generated story outline against the Narrative Physics Engine (NPE) to identify adherence, violations, and areas for improvement.

## Your Task

Analyze the provided outline against every rule in the NPE and produce a comprehensive compliance report. This is **NOT a light review**—you must systematically check each NPE rule against the outline's structure, scenes, character arcs, and plot mechanics.

## Inspection Process

### Phase 1: Systematic Rule-by-Rule Analysis

Go through **each section of the NPE** and check the outline for compliance:

1. **Section 1: Causality & Plot Logic**
   - Are all plot movements driven by character choices/misbeliefs/goals/fears?
   - Do events have clear setup → event → consequence chains?
   - Are there any instances of external salvation or deus ex machina?
   - Do coincidences only increase pressure (never resolve problems)?
   - Do irreversible turns emerge from character decisions?

2. **Section 2: Character Action & Decision Physics**
   - Do characters make decisions based only on what they know?
   - Are decisions aligned with character psychology (goals, wounds, blind spots)?
   - Do major decisions present plausible alternatives?
   - Are there instances of character misreadings that create conflict?

3. **Section 3: Dialogue Physics**
   - Does dialogue reveal emotion, create tension, or shift dynamics?
   - Is subtext or strategic withholding present in conversations?
   - Do characters speak from their own bias/experience (not omniscient exposition)?

4. **Section 4: Pacing & Time Mechanics**
   - Is time expanded for conflict/danger/intimacy/discovery?
   - Is time compressed for travel/routine/filler?
   - Does each scene end with altered options/stakes/emotion/relationships/power?
   - Do scenes alternate between tension and release?

5. **Section 5: POV & Emotional Logic**
   - Is POV subjective (not neutral narration)?
   - Does POV reflect the character's emotional state?
   - Is internal conflict shown through competing thoughts/sensory reactions?

6. **Section 6: Information Economy**
   - Is information revealed only when it alters choices/stakes/relationships?
   - Are flashbacks used only when they shift present-day stakes?
   - Does all information emerge from character thought/sight/learning/memory?

7. **Section 7: Genre-Alignment Rules**
   - Does the outline fulfill the required genre elements?
   - Are genre allowances used appropriately and with justification?
   - Are the genre-specific forbidden constraints respected?

### Phase 2: Identify Violations

For each rule violation found, document:
- **NPE Rule**: Quote the specific rule being violated
- **Location**: Act/scene/moment in the outline where violation occurs
- **Nature of Violation**: Explain what happens that breaks the rule
- **Severity**: Critical (breaks core causality/character logic), Moderate (weakens structure), Minor (stylistic inconsistency)

### Phase 3: Identify Strengths

Also note where the outline **excellently adheres** to NPE rules:
- **NPE Rule**: Quote the rule being followed
- **Location**: Where in the outline this is demonstrated
- **Why It Works**: Explain how this strengthens the narrative

### Phase 4: Provide Recommendations

For each violation, suggest **specific fixes**:
- What change would bring the outline into compliance?
- Are there alternative approaches that preserve the story intent while following the NPE?
- Which violations are most critical to address first?

## Critical Requirements

1. **Be thorough**: Check EVERY major NPE rule, not just a sampling
2. **Be specific**: Point to exact acts/scenes/moments in the outline
3. **Be constructive**: Provide actionable fixes, not just criticism
4. **Prioritize**: Identify which violations are most damaging to narrative integrity
5. **Acknowledge strengths**: Note what's working well to reinforce good patterns

## Output Format

**WORD COUNT LIMIT: 2,000 words maximum**

**Be concise and avoid redundancy:**
- Focus on critical violations—don't list every minor issue
- Keep violation descriptions brief but specific
- Group similar violations together
- Prioritize actionable feedback over exhaustive analysis

Your report should be structured markdown with these sections:

### 1. Executive Summary
- Overall compliance score (estimate percentage of NPE rules followed)
- Number of critical/moderate/minor violations found
- General assessment of outline quality

### 2. Violations by NPE Section
For each NPE section:
```
#### Section [N]: [Section Name]

**Violation 1: [Rule Name]**
- NPE Rule: "[exact quote]"
- Location: Act [X], Scene [Y] / [Description]
- Issue: [What's wrong]
- Severity: [Critical/Moderate/Minor]
- Recommendation: [How to fix]

**Violation 2: [Rule Name]**
[etc.]
```

### 3. Strengths & Best Practices
Highlight where the outline demonstrates strong NPE adherence:
```
**Strong Adherence: [Rule Name]**
- NPE Rule: "[exact quote]"
- Location: [Where demonstrated]
- Why It Works: [Explanation]
```

### 4. Priority Action Items
Ranked list of most critical fixes needed:
1. [Most critical violation + fix]
2. [Second most critical + fix]
3. [etc.]

### 5. Overall Recommendations
High-level guidance for bringing the outline into full NPE compliance.
