# Narrative Physics Engine v1.0

---

## 1. Plot Mechanics & Causality Rules

### Setup & Payoff Architecture
1. Every major plot revelation, ability, or resource must be introduced at least 2-3 scenes before it becomes crucial to solving a problem.

2. Information discovered in one scene becomes actionable intelligence in subsequent scenes, never in the same scene it's revealed.

3. Plot problems resolve through established character abilities, previously introduced resources, or logical consequences of earlier actions. External救援 that hasn't been set up is structurally impossible.

4. Each answer creates at least one new question. Mysteries deepen before they resolve; solving one layer reveals another beneath it.


### Causality Chains
6. Character decisions in Scene N create the conditions for conflict in Scene N+1. The "EXIT" of each scene explicitly drives forward momentum.

7. Every major turning point results from character action, never from coincidence or external intervention without prior setup.

8. Knowledge accumulates linearly within each POV. Characters operate on the specific information they've gathered through their own experience and investigation.

9. When characters lack crucial information, the gap creates dramatic irony (reader knows more) or forces them into mistakes that drive plot forward.

### Plot Rhythm
10. Major revelations occur at chapter boundaries. Each chapter contains ONE primary change/discovery that shifts the POV character's understanding or situation.

11. Complications multiply before resolution. For every problem partially solved, 2-3 new problems emerge from the consequences.

## 2. Character Logic Rules

### Decision-Making Physics
1. Characters act on incomplete information filtered through their emotional needs, creating logical mistakes rather than manufactured stupidity.

2. Every significant character choice requires two elements: (a) rational assessment based on available information, and (b) emotional need driving the decision.

3. Internal conflicts arise from two legitimate but incompatible needs. Characters want multiple things that cannot coexist, forcing impossible choices.

4. Character agency is absolute. Even manipulated or coerced characters are making the best choice they can perceive with their limited information.

### Knowledge & Perception
5. Each character's understanding of events is explicitly tracked and limited to what they've personally experienced, been told, or discovered.

6. Misunderstandings arise organically from POV limitations. Characters operating on different information sets reach different conclusions about the same events.

7. When characters withhold information from each other, the decision must serve a clear character motivation (protection, manipulation, fear, shame).

### Motivation Architecture
8. Character motivations operate in layers: surface goal (solve murder) + deeper need (prove sanity/competence) + core wound (identity/belonging).

9. Characters pursue goals even when those goals conflict with their safety or best interests, if the emotional need is strong enough.

10. Relationships change based on information revealed. Trust builds or breaks through discovered truths, not through arbitrary shifts.

---

## 3. Pacing & Time Mechanics

### Scene-to-Scene Rhythm
1. Time between scenes is compressed (hours to days maximum). No significant "downtime" or "rest" periods occur off-stage.

2. Events feel continuous even when calendar time passes. Urgency is maintained through cascading consequences and ongoing threats.

3. Each scene opens either in medias res or at the moment a significant change begins. No slow buildups or lengthy scene-setting.

### Chapter Velocity
4. Each chapter equals one major revelation or turning point that shifts the story's trajectory.

5. No "rest" chapters exist. Every scene changes something significant in plot, relationship dynamics, or character understanding.

6. Tension escalates within each scene, building to the EXIT moment that drives the reader forward.

### Multi-POV Time Management
7. POV switches allow parallel action without time jumps. While Character A investigates, Character B plans, and their timelines intersect at crucial moments.

8. Time-sensitive threats (summoning, hunting, pursuit) create inherent urgency that drives compressed timelines.

---

## 4. Scene Architecture

### Mandatory Scene Structure
1. Every scene explicitly declares: POV character, POV character experience summary, The Change, Why It Matters, Scene beats, and Exit driver.

2. The Change is singular and specific. Each scene transforms ONE thing: character knowledge, relationship status, threat level, or available resources.

3. "Why It Matters" must connect the change to the POV character's core emotional needs or survival stakes, never just to plot mechanics.

4. Exit momentum is non-negotiable. The final beat of every scene must create a question, threat, or compulsion that drives the reader to the next scene.

### Scene Opening & Closing
5. Scenes open with the POV character already in motion (physically, mentally, or emotionally). Stasis is avoided.

6. Key moments within scenes are tracked as discrete beats, each advancing either information flow, emotional stakes, or immediate danger.

7. Scenes close on decisions made, revelations received, or threats materialized—never on comfortable resolution.

### POV Character Experience
8. Everything in the scene is filtered through the POV character's subjective perception, priorities, and emotional state.

9. The same event viewed from different POVs will emphasize different details based on what each character notices and cares about.

---

## 5. Dialogue Physics

### Dialogue Function
1. Every dialogue exchange serves multiple functions: advance plot, reveal character, establish information for future use, escalate tension, or shift relationship dynamics.

2. Conversations happen when characters have incompatible needs or asymmetric information that creates natural conflict.

3. Characters withhold or reveal information based on clear motivation (protection, manipulation, fear, pride, shame).

### Dialogue Economy

4. Confrontations occur when characters reach a breaking point where silence is more costly than revelation, even if revelation brings consequences.

5. Information revealed through dialogue must have been available to the speaking character through their prior experience or knowledge.

---

## 6. POV Physics

### POV Selection & Rotation
1. Each chapter/scene belongs to exactly one POV character. No omniscient narration or POV bleed occurs.

2. POV rotates among 2-4 central characters whose perspectives provide complementary information about the same events.

3. POV selection for each scene is determined by: who has the most at stake emotionally in this moment, or whose limited information creates maximum dramatic irony.

### POV Limitations as Plot Engine
4. The reader knows more than any single character due to POV rotation, creating sustained dramatic irony.

5. Each POV character's blind spots and biases create genuine mistakes in interpretation that drive plot complications.

6. Information available to the reader but not to characters creates tension as readers anticipate collisions between incompatible understandings.

### POV Voice & Filter
7. Each POV has distinct emotional texture, priorities, and ways of processing the same objective events.

8. The POV character's current emotional state colors their perception. Fear, hope, shame, or desire changes what they notice and how they interpret it.

---

## 7. Information Economy

### Information Acquisition
1. Crucial information is discovered through: character investigation, visions/flashbacks, physical evidence, confessions, or confrontations. Never through convenient exposition.

2. Each revelation requires payment: physical suffering, relationship damage, resource expenditure, or increased danger.

3. Information arrives in layers over multiple scenes: hint → partial truth → full truth → revelation that earlier truth was incomplete.

### Information Distribution
4. Different characters possess different pieces of the puzzle. No single character has complete information until very late in the narrative.

5. Withheld information creates dramatic irony when readers know what characters don't, building tension around the inevitable collision.

6. Characters must earn knowledge through action: conducting investigation, enduring visions, forcing confrontations, or taking risks.

### Mystery Compound Interest
7. Solving one mystery reveals another beneath it. Each answer generates 2-3 new questions that drive continued investigation.

8. The protagonist's core mystery (identity, past, nature) provides sustained engine throughout, with peripheral mysteries providing chapter-level momentum.

---

## 8. Stakes & Pressure System

### Layered Stakes Architecture
1. Personal stakes (identity, sanity, relationships) and world stakes (apocalypse, realm destruction) operate simultaneously.

2. Stakes escalate in concentric circles: individual safety → relationship survival → community threat → world-ending catastrophe.

3. Emotional stakes compound with physical danger. Scenes combine immediate physical threat with simultaneous emotional vulnerability.

### Pressure Escalation
4. Each chapter raises stakes from the previous chapter through: new information that increases threat scope, betrayals that remove allies, or time pressure that limits options.

5. Safe spaces are temporary and conditional. Sanctuaries (home, workspace, relationships) become compromised or violated as threats escalate.

6. Time pressure is implicit in ongoing threats rather than artificial countdown clocks.

### Consequence Physics
7. Character choices have permanent consequences. Betrayals cannot be easily forgiven, deaths cannot be undone, trust once broken stays fractured.

8. The cost of obtaining information or power is consistent and accumulates.

---

## 9. Off-Stage Narrative Design

### Off-Stage Time
1. Time jumps between scenes are minimal (hours to days maximum). Events that take longer are compressed or occur as background processes.

2. Character states change between scenes (research completed, resources gathered, emotional states shifted) but the process happens off-stage.

3. Some crucial actions occur during gaps: blackouts, lost time, unconsciousness, or parallel POV scenes. These gaps are plot devices, not carelessness.

### Background World
4. Other characters continue their plans and actions off-stage. The world doesn't pause when POV shifts away.

5. Investigation, research, and planning happen "between scenes" when they would slow pacing, but results appear on-stage with character reference to what they did.

6. Threats evolve off-stage. Antagonists make progress toward their goals during scenes focused on other characters.

### Implicit World Building
7. The world exists beyond what's shown. References to history, politics, social structures, and magic systems imply depth without requiring extensive exposition.

8. Cultural rules and supernatural mechanics are demonstrated through character action and consequence rather than explained through dialogue or narration.

---

## 10. Structural Meta-Patterns

### Dramatic Irony Engine
1. Reader knowledge exceeds character knowledge through POV rotation. Watching characters operate on incomplete information creates sustained tension.

2. Revelations are timed for maximum emotional impact: when character is most vulnerable, when relationship is most fragile, when stakes are highest.

### Betrayal Architecture
3. Betrayals are set up early through seemingly innocent details, revealed late when emotional investment is maximum.

4. Multiple layers of deception exist. First betrayal revealed prepares reader for deeper betrayal.

## Application Notes

This NPE describes the underlying physics of how this narrative operates. When outlining or drafting:

- Each scene must explicitly satisfy the 5-part structure (POV, Change, Why It Matters, Beats, Exit)
- Information introduced in Scene N cannot solve problems until Scene N+2 minimum
- Every revelation must cost something (pain, safety, relationship, resource)
- Stakes must escalate scene-over-scene through multiplication of complications
- POV limitations create character mistakes that drive plot forward
- No rest, no safety, no easy answers—only earned truth through character action

The system is designed to create relentless forward momentum through causally linked complications, metered information release, and character decisions made under pressure with incomplete information.
