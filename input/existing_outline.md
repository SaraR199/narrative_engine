# Your Existing Book Outline

Replace this file with your actual book outline.

## What to Include

Your outline should contain the narrative structure from another book project you've worked on. This will be analyzed to extract your **generic writing preferences** (not specific to that book, but your underlying patterns).

Include:
- Plot structure and major beats
- Character arcs and decision points
- Scene descriptions and pacing notes
- Dialogue samples (if any)
- POV choices and transitions
- How stakes escalate
- Cause-and-effect chains
- Information release patterns

## Why This Matters

The more complete your outline, the better the NPE (Narrative Physics Engine) extraction will be. The subagent will analyze:

- **What patterns appear** (your preferences)
- **What patterns are absent** (your dislikes)
- **How you structure causality**
- **Your pacing rhythms**
- **Your character logic**

The resulting NPE will become the constraint system for future workflow steps, ensuring your new book matches your creative style.
