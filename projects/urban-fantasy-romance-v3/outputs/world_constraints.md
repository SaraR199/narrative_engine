# World Constraints Document

## Geography & Movement

**Core Constraints:**

- **Overlay occupation, not separation** - Supernatural world occupies the same physical Portland as mundane city. No pocket dimensions to escape to; the Veil creates perceptual blind spots, not spatial separation.

- **Territorial boundaries are invisible but enforced** - Downtown is contested patchwork requiring political navigation. Pearl District (fae), Southeast Powell (shifters), St. Johns (witches) have established claims with consequences for trespassing.

- **Weak points are dangerous zones** - Shanghai Tunnels, Pittock Mansion, Cathedral Park, and Mara's breach location are structurally fragile. Lingering risks accidental exposure, further damage, or attracting entities. Mara's awakening site is monitored crime scene.

- **Forest Park is neutral sanctuary** - No territorial claims allowed. Provides safe meeting ground but prevents privacy (anyone can access it).

- **Portland's weirdness provides cover but attracts sensitives** - City eccentricity masks supernatural activity but also draws humans with dormant bloodlines. Higher ambient breach risk.

**Plotting Implications:**

Characters can't flee Portland—investigation and Veil crisis are localized here. Mara can't avoid supernatural territories while living normal life; overlay ensures constant proximity to danger. Faction politics constrain safe locations. Neutral ground offers no privacy. Every location serves double duty (mundane + supernatural), preventing clean separation.

## Cultural & Social Rules

**Core Constraints:**

- **Veil secrecy is absolute law** - Exposing supernatural world to unprepared humans threatens all factions. Punishment: memory modification (psychologically scarring), exile (death sentence), or termination. Mara's breach made her victim and criminal simultaneously.

- **Memory modification is legal but controversial** - Leaves psychological scars, gaps, trauma without context. Mara views it as autonomy violation (dealbreaker). Creates ethical trap: protect Veil vs. respect individual agency.

- **Fated bonds are culturally contested** - Half view them as genuine compatibility; half see coercion. Mara and Kieran's relationship carries social baggage—skepticism, judgment, pressure to conform.

- **Species hierarchies create friction** - Vampires and fae dominate politically. Shifters resent second-class status. Witches guard knowledge. "Other" category has no power bloc. Prejudices simmer beneath Commission unity.

- **Commission investigators operate outside hierarchy** - Kieran can cross territories, compel testimony, make binding judgments. Creates freedom and isolation. Makes him target for those who resent oversight.

- **Awakened humans are debated** - Recruit? Suppress? Eliminate? No settled policy. Mara exists in legal gray area—her fate depends on political outcome.

**Plotting Implications:**

Mara can't tell Riley truth without triggering intervention. Kieran can't publicly claim relationship under investigation. Fated bond complicates rather than simplifies. Species politics mean allies carry factional agendas. Mara's hybrid status makes her vulnerable to policy shifts.

## Resource & Economic Pressures

**Core Constraints:**

- **Magic has physiological cost** - Small workings cause fatigue. Major spells demand pain, exhaustion, or sacrifice. Overextension breaks practitioner (permanent damage, death). Mara's untrained power burns dangerously; can't sustain prolonged combat.

- **Specialization creates dependency** - No practitioner commands all magic. Kieran's specialties (Veil magic, binding, investigation) exclude offensive combat or healing. Complex problems require teams.

- **Information is controlled currency** - Commission monopolizes archives. Knowledge about Mara's bloodline, historical breaches, factional agreements lives in Dekum Building. Access requires Kieran's authority. Losing it cripples investigation.

- **Territory equals power** - Contested downtown represents leverage. Controlling high-traffic areas means controlling commerce and information. Characters without territorial claim are guests everywhere.

- **Favors and debts are supernatural economy** - Fae operate on impossible-to-track obligations. Accepting help creates debt; refusing insults. Mara lacks cultural knowledge to navigate this. Every alliance has invisible price.

**Plotting Implications:**

Mara can't brute-force with raw power—untrained abilities are potent but exhausting. Characters need teams, creating trust vulnerabilities. Losing Kieran's Commission access cripples investigation. Every favor costs later. Information scarcity means operating with incomplete knowledge and making consequential mistakes.

## Technology & Magic Limits

**Core Constraints:**

- **Veil Sense is rare** - Only Kieran and Mara perceive barrier structure. Makes them uniquely valuable but also targets. Can't outsource; they're irreplaceable.

- **Magic is intuitive, not scientific** - Same spell gets different results based on understanding, intention, emotion. No standardized procedures. Unreliable under stress. Mara's trauma-activated powers are volatile.

- **No universal magic** - Every supernatural type has different rules. Fae bound by truth/bargains/hospitality; iron disrupts their magic. Shifters vulnerable to silver. Vampires weakened by sunlight, bound by invitation rules at sanctified thresholds. Solutions that work for one faction fail for others.

- **Belief shapes reality** - Veil works because both sides believe in separation. Breaking consensus accelerates collapse.

- **Fated bond amplifies but doesn't control** - Enhances abilities in proximity, creates intuitive understanding, enables shared workings. Doesn't mandate emotions or override agency. Pull is real; what they do with it remains choice.

- **Technology and magic interact unpredictably** - Cameras catch supernatural shadows. Tech malfunctions near magic. Mara's photography is evidence tool but also breach risk.

**Plotting Implications:**

Can't recruit other Veil specialists—forced proximity is functional necessity. Magic doesn't provide easy solutions; stress makes powers dangerous. Cross-species alliances require navigating incompatible rules. Photographic evidence is double-edged. Fated bond creates advantages but doesn't resolve trust or agency questions.

## Time & Deadlines

**Core Constraints:**

- **Veil collapse timeline: weeks to months** - Catastrophic failure inevitable unless source stopped. Countdown clock—no time for slow investigation or careful relationship building.

- **Each breach weakens structure** - Mara's breach damaged interconnected network. Subsequent breaches compound exponentially. Time pressure increases as investigation progresses.

- **No recovery periods** - Trauma accumulates without healing between incidents. No breaks to process, train, or build trust slowly. Relief undercut by complications immediately.

- **Kieran's immortality vs. Mara's mortality** - 300 years shapes his time sense (patience, historical perspective). She has human urgency and lifespan. Creates friction: his "wait and see" conflicts with her "act now."

- **Magical awakening stabilization window** - Without training, Mara's abilities will stabilize or destabilize. Window for safe integration is limited. Waiting isn't option.

**Plotting Implications:**

Can't afford careful investigation—Veil weakens daily. Must build trust under pressure, before ready. Romance escalates through forced proximity; intimacy can't develop naturally. Mara's rushed training makes her liability. "What happens after?" looms—surviving crisis doesn't solve mortality gap. No breathing room prevents processing trauma.

## Information & Communication Barriers

**Core Constraints:**

- **Humans unconsciously cooperate with Veil** - Minds smooth inconsistencies, rationalize impossible, forget strange encounters. Perceptual filter working as designed. Mundane witnesses unreliable; accounts omit or distort supernatural elements.

- **Memory modification leaves scars** - Creates psychological damage, unexplained gaps, trauma without context. If Riley gets modified, Mara loses authentic relationship. If Riley refuses, she becomes security risk.

- **Commission information monopoly** - Archives, records, precedent centralized at Dekum Building. Losing Kieran's access means losing investigation resources. No alternative sources with equivalent depth.

- **Dormant bloodlines create perceptual static** - Those with latent magic sense wrongness (déjà vu, feeling watched, glimpses) but can't break through without trigger. Mara experienced this her whole life. Means potential future breaches exist.

- **Factional information hoarding** - Each faction has intel relevant to investigation but sharing means losing advantage. Every piece requires negotiation, favors, or coercion.

- **Digital age creates Veil vulnerabilities** - Cameras, smartphones, social media mean evidence proliferates. One viral video could shatter Veil. Commission must constantly monitor/suppress documentation.

**Plotting Implications:**

Mara can't tell Riley without triggering modification (violation) or making her security risk. Human witnesses can't help—perceptions filtered. Losing Kieran's access cripples resources. Every faction withholds intel. Mara's photos must be secured. Characters operate with incomplete knowledge, making consequential mistakes.

## Power Structures & Authority

**Core Constraints:**

- **Commission holds binding authority** - Investigators can cross territories, compel testimony, make judgments. Power comes from consensus among factions. Authority real but fragile—depends on unified belief in necessity.

- **Magically enforced contracts have supernatural consequences** - Breaking Commission binding causes magical backlash varying by individual's nature. Makes compliance compulsory. Characters who accept bindings lose agency.

- **Exile from protection is death sentence** - Without community support and Veil shelter, supernatural beings become vulnerable. Exile means banishment from only world they can safely inhabit.

- **Termination for existential threats** - Commission can authorize execution. Rare but possible. Mara technically qualifies (broke through, has dangerous untrained abilities). Only Kieran's judgment keeps her alive.

- **Seven-seat Council creates gridlock** - Major decisions require consensus from competing factions. Ancient prejudices and agendas make unified action nearly impossible. Crisis decisions delayed by politics.

- **Field investigators operate autonomously** - Kieran has broad authority but minimal oversight. Enables heroism or corruption equally. His decisions about Mara are provisional—Council can overrule.

- **Species hierarchies persist** - Vampires and fae dominate despite official equality. Shifters, witches, "other" have nominal seats but less real power.

**Plotting Implications:**

Kieran's judgment is Mara's only protection from termination. If compromised, she loses shield. His autonomy enables rule-bending but without safety net. Commission unity is provisional; crisis could shatter alliances. Mara can't appeal decisions. Defying Commission risks exile. Political gridlock means slow institutional response; can't wait for permission.

## Vibes Parameters

**Aesthetic/Tonal Mode:** **Propulsive Urban Fantasy with Bantery Intimacy and Visceral Stakes**

Contemporary Portland where coffee shops and shadow markets occupy same space. Magic feels dangerous—physical sensation tied to emotion, powers manifesting through stress. Dialogue crackles with wit; surface never equals actual meaning. No breathing room between crises. Romance escalates through forced proximity before emotional trust.

**Core Constraints:**

- **Banter is armor and foreplay** - Characters deflect vulnerability through sharp dialogue. Genuine emotion terrifies; wit provides distance. Mara and Kieran's chemistry manifests as intellectual combat. Tone doesn't allow maudlin confessions; vulnerability emerges through subtext and micro-moments.

- **Magic is visceral, not sanitized** - Powers hurt. Overextension breaks bodies. Fated bond manifests as physical pull, temperature changes, proximity awareness. Not elegant but gritty—abilities come with blood, exhaustion, pain.

- **Relentless pacing with escalating pressure** - Revelations force choices within 1-3 scenes. Relief undercut immediately. Investigation spawns consequences, not solutions. Time pressure prevents slow anything. Characters react and adapt; no space to process fully.

- **Contemporary setting prevents archaic solutions** - Modern Portland with smartphones, surveillance, social media. Can't rely on pre-digital secrecy strategies. Technology creates Veil vulnerabilities (viral videos, photos, digital records). Grounds supernatural in recognizable reality.

- **Romance through danger before emotional safety** - Attraction and bond create instant chemistry, but trust lags. Forced together by crisis before emotionally ready. Vulnerability terrifies more than threats. Love requires courage to choose.

- **Morally complex "protection"** - Memory modification, withholding information, paternalistic control presented as genuinely complicated, not purely evil. Commission enforcement is flawed but has prevented apocalypse for centuries.

**Plotting Implications:**

No slow-burn with organic trust-building—crisis escalates attraction faster than readiness. Scenes must crackle with tension, advance multiple agendas. Magic doesn't solve problems; costs, hurts, fails under stress. Investigation propulsive but messy. Characters can't earnestly confess—vulnerability through action, subtext, accidental guard-drops. Vibe prevents grimdark nihilism (too much hope) and cozy safety (too much danger).

## Constraint Interactions

Veil secrecy + Mara's relationships = ethical trap. Can't tell Riley truth without triggering memory modification (violates both autonomies) or making Riley security risk. Protecting Riley means lying, potentially destroying friendship through perceived betrayal.

Time pressure (weeks to collapse) + trust-building needs = forced vulnerability. Must cooperate intimately before emotionally ready. Investigation demands shared workings and proximity, but wounds (her abandonment, his loss) make trust terrifying. External clock forces faster intimacy than internal readiness allows.

Kieran's Commission authority = Mara's protection AND relationship obstacle. His judgment shields her from termination, but claiming romantic involvement compromises objectivity—potential suspension. Can't publicly acknowledge bond without threatening authority that keeps her alive.

Information scarcity + Mara's untrained abilities = dangerous ignorance. Needs knowledge to control power, but accessing knowledge requires trusting doubtful institutions. Operating without complete information means consequential mistakes; waiting means abilities destabilize. Both options carry existential risk.

Species prejudices + factional tensions = coalition-building complexity. Every faction has competing interests; trusting one antagonizes another. Must navigate centuries-old grudges while countdown runs. Political complexity slows response when speed is survival.

## Critical "No-Go" Solutions

**Characters CANNOT tell Riley about supernatural world because:**
Veil secrecy enforced by memory modification (psychologically scarring, violates Mara's autonomy values) or worse. Commission monitors breaches. Knowing makes Riley security risk—Commission doesn't trust humans. Options: lie to best friend (damages relationship) or trigger intervention erasing memories and authentic connection.

**Characters CANNOT wait out investigation slowly because:**
Veil collapse timeline weeks to months. Each breach accelerates decay exponentially. Methodical approach means arriving at answer after crisis triggered. Time pressure forces mistakes, incomplete preparation, premature trust.

**Mara CANNOT refuse magical training because:**
Trauma-activated abilities will stabilize or destabilize. Window for safe integration limited. Untrained, she's threat to herself and others—Commission has legal grounds for containment or termination. Training requires trusting when wound makes trust terrifying.

**Kieran CANNOT openly defy Commission without losing protective authority because:**
His professional judgment shields Mara from termination. Field investigators' autonomy is provisional—Council can overrule dissent. Open defiance means suspension, loss of archive access, loss of authority to judge her status. Rebellion must be covert or he loses power to protect her.

**Characters CANNOT flee Portland because:**
Veil breaches localized here; investigation requires staying at epicenter. Leaving abandons both worlds. Mara has mundane life she can't abandon without raising questions. Commission would pursue.

**Mara CANNOT accept memory modification to "reset" because:**
Would erase awakening, Veil Sense, knowledge, fated bond awareness. Violates core autonomy value. Commission needs her Veil Sense for investigation—erasing eliminates diagnostic tool.

**Characters CANNOT solve conspiracy through pure combat because:**
Magic costs—overextension breaks or kills. Mara untrained; sustained confrontation exhausts her. Kieran's specializations exclude offensive combat. Antagonist likely has allies and defenses. Brute force plays to enemy strengths, ignores actual advantages (investigation, Veil Sense, political maneuvering).
