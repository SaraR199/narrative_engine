# **MAIN CHARACTER TEMPLATE — Version 1.1**

**Character: SERA VOLKOV**

---

# **1. CHARACTER CORE**

**Name:**
Sera Volkov (alias "Sera Kaine" for three years during infiltration)

**Role in Story:**
Protagonist / FMC / Dragon Enforcer / Investigator

**Core Contradiction (X but also Y):**
Ruthlessly controlled but emotionally volatile — Sera maintains iron self-discipline to suppress her Storm dragon electrical interference in a Fire dragon organization, yet beneath the surface she's a maelstrom of unprocessed rage and grief threatening to expose her. She's the daughter of truth-seekers who weaponized lying, a survivor consumed by survivor's guilt, a woman forged into a weapon who craves safety she believes she doesn't deserve.

**Core Wound:**
Sera returned from a mission to find her entire clan massacred. She wasn't there when they died, and the survivor's guilt layered with identity obliteration created a wound that says: "I should have died with them, and the only way to atone is to destroy the person responsible."

**Core Lie:**
"I am nothing but the weapon aimed at Darius Kael. Without my hatred and revenge quest, I'm empty—a traitor who survived when everyone I loved died. I don't deserve peace, happiness, or love."

**External Want:**
Kill Darius Kael to avenge her clan's massacre. After her failed assassination attempt, it becomes "survive long enough to find another opportunity while gathering evidence of his crimes."

**Internal Need:**
To grieve properly rather than weaponizing her loss. To reclaim her Volkov heritage as a toolkit (truth-seeking, investigation, verification) rather than a wound. To accept that moving forward and finding connection isn't betraying the dead—it's honoring them by preventing others from suffering the same fate.

---

# **2. FLAW SYSTEM (MULTI-EXPRESSION)**

**Primary Flawed Strategy:**
Revenge as identity replacement — Sera channels unbearable grief into killing Darius because rage is easier than devastation. She clings to her revenge narrative because without it, she'd face the terrifying emptiness of having lost everything that defined her. The revenge quest gives her purpose, and challenging this narrative feels like dying.

**Secondary Flawed Strategies:**

- **Hyper-control as safety** — Her world shattered once, so she micromanages everything: emotional displays, cover identity, physical environment, information access. She makes elaborate contingency plans, never fully commits, always maintains an exit strategy. When control is threatened, she becomes brittle and aggressive.

- **Isolation as protection** — She keeps everyone at arm's length through sarcasm and refusal to show vulnerability. She tells herself it's operational security, but closeness means risk of loss she can't survive again. She sabotages connections before they matter.

- **Truth-seeking avoidance** — The deepest irony: she comes from a clan specializing in verification, but refuses to investigate her fundamental assumption about Darius's guilt. She weaponizes her Volkov training while violating the core principle: verify before you act.

**Shadow Trait:**
Tenderness and nurturing protectiveness — Sera is capable of profound gentleness and fierce protective loyalty, demonstrated before the massacre in how she mentored younger clan members and created safety for others. She's suppressed this because it makes her feel too much and seems like betraying her family. When this trait emerges involuntarily, she immediately compensates with cold pragmatism or cruelty.

# **3. VALUES & BOUNDARIES**

**Top Values:**

1. **Loyalty to the dead / Honoring her clan's memory** — Her north star, though her understanding evolves from vengeance at any cost to truth-seeking and prevention.

2. **Competence / Being useful** — She cannot tolerate helplessness. Her value is measured by what she accomplishes, stemming from survivor's guilt.

3. **Truth and information integrity** — Her Volkov heritage. Even while lying about her identity, she viscerally hates being lied to and information manipulation.

**Hard Boundaries:**

- Will not harm innocents or use civilians as collateral damage
- Will not abandon someone in immediate mortal danger, even an enemy
- Will not falsify evidence or manufacture proof
- Will not beg or grovel—she'll die first

**Temptations:**

- The opportunity to kill Darius might make her accept civilian casualties
- Protecting someone she cares about could tempt her to falsify evidence
- Extreme torture could break her control
- Discovering honoring her family means something different than revenge

# **4. EMOTIONAL & BEHAVIORAL PALETTES**

### **Anxiety Palette**

- **Internal:** Danger-sensing Storm affinity activates—prickling at skull base, pressure building like an incoming storm, hypersensitive skin. Racing thoughts fragment into contingency planning.

- **Physical:** Jaw tension creating headaches. Hands want to move—check weapons, adjust clothing. When forcing stillness, fingers tap rapid patterns against her thigh.

- **Verbal:** Questions become sharper, more interrogative. Demands specifics. "What exactly do you mean by 'soon'?" "Give me numbers, not estimates."

### **Attraction Palette**

- **Physical:** Electrical interference intensifies—Storm affinity recognizes Darius's Fire heat. Sparks jump between them when close. Lights flicker, phones die, hair stands on end. Hyper-aware of his body heat before they touch—uncomfortable, unsettling, increasingly magnetic.

- **Internal:** Danger-sense triggers wrong—pulling her toward him instead of away. Visceral frustration with herself for noticing details she shouldn't care about.

- **Verbal:** Sarcasm intensifies defensively. The more attracted, the more cutting her remarks. Banter becomes charged, combative—verbal sparring substituting for what she won't allow.

- **Physical:** Creates distance—steps back, maintains furniture barriers, angles body away.

### **Anger Palette**

- **Cold/Controlled:** Voice drops, quieter and more precise. Words chosen like weapons. Temperature drops as Storm affinity pulls energy; electronics malfunction; lights dim.

- **Sharp/Reactive:** Static electricity discharge—literal sparks. Hair stands up, small objects move in electromagnetic field. Clipped, staccato sentences.

- **Self-Protective:** Shuts down conversation, walks away mid-sentence. Later punishes herself with brutal training, channeling rage into violence.

- **Explosive:** Everything electronic within twenty feet dies. Lights shatter. Ozone smell, temperature drop, pressure before lightning. Speaks with terrible calm while destruction happens around her.

### **Grief Palette**

- **Suppressed:** Goes silent—not peaceful, but absent. Face becomes mask, movements mechanical. Completes tasks robotically while feeling nothing.

- **Triggered:** Specific sensory details unravel her—mother's perfume on a stranger, father's phrases, children laughing like her young cousins. She freezes, transported, has to physically shake herself back to present.

- **Weaponized:** Transforms grief into rage because rage is active. The moment devastation rises, she redirects it into revenge quest, training, sharpening herself as a weapon.

- **Released:** When she finally allows true grief, it's physically violent—gasping sobs like drowning, uncontrollable shaking, storm of electrical discharge mirroring emotional tempest.

### **Vulnerability Palette**

- **Initial:** Deflects with humor or sarcasm. Provides information that sounds personal but isn't revealing. "My tragic backstory? Get in line."

- **Defensive:** Becomes hostile when someone approaches real emotion. Attacks first, establishes dominance.

- **Tentative:** Offers small truths, tests whether they'll be used against her. Watches reactions intensely, ready to retreat.

- **Genuine:** Admits fear, pain, need without armor. Extraordinarily difficult; only happens after arc Breaking Point.

---

# **5. VOICE & LANGUAGE PALETTE**

**Syntax Tendencies:**
Short, declarative sentences when controlled. Clipped and precise, often omitting unnecessary words. "Three exits. Two guards. One window." When emotionally compromised, sentences fragment. Under stress, defaults to interrogatives: questions instead of statements.

**Dialogue Patterns:**
- Heavy dark humor and sarcasm as armor
- Deflects personal questions by redirecting
- Speaks in tactical/operational terms: "Extract ourselves" not "leave"
- Rarely uses qualifiers—no "maybe," "perhaps." States things as fact
- Russian terms under stress (малыш/"baby," дурак/"fool"), phrases her father used
- When lying, provides excessive specific detail to sell deception
- When telling truth that matters, becomes almost monosyllabic

**Internal Metaphor Style:**
Storm and weather metaphors reflecting her dragon affinity: emotions build like pressure systems, situations feel like incoming storms, people categorized as grounding influences or lightning rods. Also uses investigation terminology: "catalogs" details, "files away" information, treats interactions as "interrogations."

**Sensory Bias:**
Electrical/energetic awareness first—electromagnetic signatures, static potential, energy flow. Then tactical/spatial: exits, weapons, positioning, threats. Touch is hypersensitive (electrically charged skin). Temperature intense (especially Darius's Fire-dragon heat). Sound survival-critical. Smell connects to memory and grief.

---

# **6. CONTEXT STATES**

### **Baseline State:**

Controlled, alert, slightly distant. Maintains "Sera Kaine" cover: competent enforcer seeking belonging. Moves with economical efficiency. Observes more than speaks. Dry humor keeps people entertained but not close. Constantly aware of electrical interference. Sleeps lightly, trains obsessively. Loneliness managed through routine and purpose.

### **Mild Stress State:**

Control tightens. Speech more clipped. Actively manages environment—positioning near exits, checking weapons, verifying information redundantly. Internal monologue accelerates into contingency planning. Electronics become slightly unreliable. Withdraws from social interaction, more businesslike. Sarcasm has sharper edges. Hypervigilant about maintaining cover. Fragmented sleep.

### **Extreme Stress State:**

Armor cracks. Electrical interference obvious and dangerous—lights shatter, phones die, electronics malfunction catastrophically. Storm building inside her, moments from exposure. Fight response triggers—aggression as last defense. Voice stays quiet or goes completely silent. Makes high-risk decisions. Boundary between past trauma and present danger dissolves—she's in both timelines simultaneously. If she can't remove herself, she dissociates.

# **7. ARC STATES (CHARACTER EVOLUTION)**

### **Version 1 – Beginning**

- **Conflict Response:** Views every conflict through "how does this serve my revenge quest?" Approaches problems tactically. Defaults to violence when faster than negotiation. Sees Darius as ultimate enemy. Zero interest in resolution—only victory.

- **Flaw Expression:** Clings desperately to revenge narrative. Dismisses contradicting evidence. Uses isolation and sarcasm aggressively. Micromanages everything controllable. Weaponizes grief—crushes softness with remembered images of dead family.

- **Vulnerability Pattern:** Absolutely refuses it. Deflects with humor, hostility, tactical redirection. Shares false vulnerability (cover story) while protecting real self. Physical intimacy endured as operational necessity.

### **Version 2 – Midpoint**

- **New Awareness:** Recognizes revenge obsession prevented actual investigation. Notices her Volkov training screams that something doesn't add up about the official narrative. Realizes she's hunted Darius while refusing to hunt truth, violating everything her family stood for.

- **Behavioral Shift:** Starts asking questions instead of assuming answers. Uses truth-seeking skills on massacre itself. Allows moments of genuine connection with Darius. Experiences involuntary protectiveness without immediately suppressing it.

- **Emerging Fear:** Terrified revenge narrative is false, meaning three years wasted, identity built on lie, nothing underneath. Fears falling for Darius means betraying family. Afraid proper grief will destroy her. Scared of who she is without hatred.

### **Version 3 – Climax**

- **Defining Growth Decision:** Chooses truth over comfortable lies. When confronted with evidence Darius didn't orchestrate the massacre, she accepts it. Uses fully accessible Volkov abilities to identify actual traitor and expose conspiracy. Trusts Darius completely in life-or-death situation. Consciously chooses mating bond as both dragon instinct AND genuine choice.

- **Old Behavior Resisted:** Urge to retreat into isolation and revenge fantasy. Temptation to sacrifice herself rather than trusting others. Instinct to suppress tender/protective shadow trait. Recognizes patterns, actively fights them, makes different choices.

### **Version 4 – Aftermath**

- **Relationship to Core Wound:** No longer believes she failed her family by surviving. Understands honoring them means living fully and using inherited skills to protect others. Has grieved properly—ugly, devastating, necessary. Guilt hasn't vanished but no longer defines her.

- **Persistent Habit:** Still struggles with vulnerability, defaults to sarcasm when uncomfortable. Still hypervigilant and tactically minded. Control issues remain; she's learned to recognize fear-driven micromanaging and course-correct. Trust still requires conscious effort. Electrical interference spikes with high emotions. Grown enormously but remains recognizably herself.

# **8. RELATIONSHIP-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR**

### **With Darius Kael (love interest):**

- **Persona Evolution:**
  - **V1:** Hostile professionalism. Competent enforcer playing along with fake-mate strategy for survival. Every word calculated, communicates contempt.
  - **V2-V3:** Persona cracks. Shows genuine reactions—resented attraction, unwanted respect, involuntary protectiveness. Sarcasm becomes banter.
  - **V4:** Drops armor in private. Shows fear, admits need, asks for help.

- **What They Hide:**
  - Initially: True identity, infiltration extent, assassination intent, Storm heritage
  - Mid-arc: Growing feelings and terror of betraying family
  - Late arc: Nothing—resolution requires transparency

- **Conflict Pattern:** Verbal sparring equal parts hostility and foreplay. Challenges everything, refuses submission, weaponizes truth. Conflicts escalate physically—electrical interference vs. fire heat, literal sparks. Fights dirty, respects competent resistance. Increasingly about intimacy-avoidance rather than genuine enmity.

- **Connection Pattern:** Involuntary understanding—they read each other with unsettling accuracy. Shared silences feel like conversations. Physical awareness both threat-assessment and attraction. Moments of unexpected gentleness. Trust built through actions—protecting each other before consciously deciding to.

### **With Alexei (Darius's brother, blood mage):**

- **Persona:** Wary professionalism with mutual respect. Competent investigator needing his blood magic expertise. More honest because he's perceptive enough to catch lies.

- **What They Hide:** Full emotional devastation depth. How much his blood magic unnerves her.

- **Conflict Pattern:** Ideological disagreements about methods and costs. Intellectual debates that get heated but don't become personal.

- **Connection Pattern:** Shared outsider status. Mutual trauma survivor recognition. Comfortable silence, trusting each other's competence. She defers to his magical expertise.

### **With Elena (Darius's ex-fiancée):**

- **Persona:** Surface courtesy masking intense assessment. Not intimidated by Elena's history or power. Polite, professional, subtly dominant.

- **What They Hide:** Insecurity about mate bond reality, jealousy, grudging respect.

- **Conflict Pattern:** Verbal chess. Speak in subtext, never stating tensions directly. Compete through wit and strategic maneuvering.

- **Connection Pattern:** (Later) Recognition of shared goals. Grudging respect. Pragmatic alliance without friendship.

### **With Yuri (Kael enforcer):**

- **Persona:** Competent but subordinate enforcer. Lets him lead, presents as willing to learn, grateful for acceptance.

- **What They Hide:** True identity and skill level. Deliberately underperforms.

- **Conflict Pattern:** Defers to avoid conflict. Frames disagreements as questions.

- **Connection Pattern:** Limited, professional distance. Represents sacrificed ability to have genuine colleague connections.

# **AI IMPLEMENTATION RULESET**

- **Rotate emotional and behavioral palettes:** Don't repeat identical gestures or phrases within 3-4 scenes. Use variety provided.

- **Express flaws through multiple strategies:** Rotate between hyper-control, isolation tactics, truth-seeking avoidance, and primary flaw. Let context determine which dominates.

- **Use appropriate context state:** Match behavior to scene's pressure level.

- **Use arc version based on story progression:** Early chapters use V1 exclusively. After midpoint revelation, V2. After climax choice, V3 then V4. Don't regress unless specifically backsliding.

- **Use relationship-specific dynamics:** Sera with Darius differs from Sera with Alexei differs from Sera with Elena.

- **Electrical interference as emotion barometer:** Flickering lights = mild agitation. Phone dying = significant stress. Electronics exploding = control lost.

- **Sensory grounding:** Regularly include her specific sensory awareness.

- **Dialogue voice consistency:** Maintain clipped syntax, dark humor, tactical terminology, deflection patterns.

# **NPE COMPLIANCE NOTES**

**Causality & Plot Logic:**
- Investigation skills drive plot through active evidence discovery, not coincidence
- Truth-seeking abilities extract psychological cost—using them while maintaining emotional lies causes internal conflict and electrical surges risking exposure
- Revenge quest motivated by wound and fear
- Deception has clear motivation rooted in wound and goal

**Character Action & Decision Physics:**
- All decisions filter through emotional wound and bias
- Misinterprets events through specific lens: obsessed interpret boundaries as temporary obstacles, traumatized interpret normalcy as threat
- Protective withholding creates escalating consequences
- Cannot "choose better" until confronting wound driving revenge obsession

**Dialogue Physics:**
- Evades direct questions through deflection, partial truths, sarcasm, answering different questions
- Deepest fears emerge through what she demands from others, what she can't tolerate losing, specific lies she tells herself
- Crucial revelations come through emotional compromise, accidental slips, mistakes revealing knowledge she shouldn't have

**POV & Emotional Logic:**
- POV colored by wound: filters events through threat lens, debt to dead, unworthiness for happiness
- Internal narration contradicts external behavior when hiding pain, denying needs, rationalizing harmful choices
- Physical sensations convey emotional states

**Information Economy:**
- Truth-seeking abilities require investigation of physical evidence; can't intuit answers
- Discoveries emerge through artifacts, conflicting accounts, fragmented memories, locations triggering sense memory
- Holds crucial hidden pieces: real identity, infiltration scope, true skill level, growing feelings
- Lies revealed through possessing knowledge she shouldn't have

**Stakes & Pressure:**
- Personal stakes parallel external stakes
- Power escalation creates new vulnerabilities
- Each revelation forces questioning previous certainty

**Genre Alignment:**
- Supernatural connection complicates rather than solves—creates ethical dilemma
- Actively questions whether feelings are genuine or magically compelled
- Transformation requires plot events to trigger
- Cannot resolve romantically while major deception remains or external threat is active
