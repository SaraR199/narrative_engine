# **NARRATIVE PHYSICS ENGINE v1.0**

---

## **SECTION 1: CAUSALITY & PLOT LOGIC**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. All plot movement must arise from characters' choices, misbeliefs, goals, fears, or interpersonal dynamics.**

**2. Events require clear setup → event → consequence chains. Setup may be subtle but must exist minimum 2 scenes prior.**

**3. External salvation is structurally impossible. Major obstacles resolve only through character action built from prior setup.**

**4. Coincidences increase pressure, worsen conflict, or reduce options. Never resolve problems or simplify paths.**

**5. Irreversible turns emerge from character decision or misjudgment, not external forces.**

**6. Investigation-driven plots advance through character initiative, never through convenient information delivery.** Characters must actively seek, risk, and earn discoveries.

**7. Supernatural revelations require physical cost or risk to access.** Visions, memories, or hidden knowledge exact immediate toll (pain, blood, vulnerability).

**8. Past connections drive present conflict.** Current antagonism must root in established history, even if initially hidden from protagonist.

**9. Power acquired through suffering has mechanical cost.** Abilities gained through trauma, theft, or bargain carry ongoing price in the present.

---

## **SECTION 2: CHARACTER ACTION & DECISION PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Characters decide based only on what they know, not what reader knows.**

**2. Decisions align with:**
- Personal goals
- Wounds
- Blind spots
- Biases
- Relational tension
- Emotional context

**3. Every major decision presents 2-3 plausible alternatives. Character chooses based on psychology, not plot convenience.**

**4. Characters misinterpret events regularly, creating escalation or conflict.**

**5. Professional identity must conflict with supernatural reality when character operates in both spheres.** Detective/cop protagonists cannot seamlessly accept impossible evidence.

**6. Trust issues must isolate characters from potential allies.** Withholding information creates vulnerability that worsens outcomes.

### **Secondary Rules**

- Characters rarely articulate true motives directly
- Emotional residue carries into subsequent scenes
- Deception backfires catastrophically within 3-5 scenes of implementation

---

## **SECTION 3: DIALOGUE PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Dialogue reveals emotion, creates tension, or shifts relationship dynamics. Cannot simply restate.**

**2. Minimum one layer of subtext or strategic withholding per conversation.**

**3. Characters speak from cognitive bias and lived experience, not omniscient exposition.**

**4. Intimate confessions occur only under duress or crisis pressure.** Voluntary vulnerability is structurally rare.

**5. Partner banter or professional shorthand masks underlying supernatural horror.** Surface normalcy contrasts with impossible stakes.

**6. Direct questions about critical information receive evasive answers until questioner forces confrontation.**

### **Conditional Rules**

Exposition permitted only if:
1. Speaker actively persuades, manipulates, justifies, or deflects
2. Information changes stakes or choices immediately
3. Confession extracted under threat, pain, or relationship rupture

---

## **SECTION 4: PACING & TIME MECHANICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Expand time for conflict, danger, intimacy, discovery, emotional shifts.**

**2. Compress time for travel, routine, repeated actions, filler.**

**3. Every scene ends with consequence altering:**
- Options
- Stakes
- Emotion
- Relationships
- Power dynamics

**4. Energy state cannot remain static. Alternate tension and release.**

**5. Intimate scenes immediately followed by crisis, violence, or devastating revelation.** Emotional safety never sustained beyond single scene.

**6. Multi-POV structures alternate between characters per chapter/scene.** Each POV shift advances timeline and raises stakes.

**7. Investigation scenes end with discovery that worsens situation or raises new questions.**

### **Transition Rules**

**1. Each transition contains directional change (stakes, emotion, goal, location, time).**

**2. Off-stage events referenced through:**
- Changed conditions
- Dialogue fragments
- Emotional impact
- Environmental clues

---

## **SECTION 5: POV & EMOTIONAL LOGIC**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. POV is subjective, misinterpreting events, omitting details, focusing on sensory biases.**

**2. POV reflects emotional state, not neutral narration.**

**3. Internal conflict shown through:**
- Competing thoughts
- Sensory reactions
- Contradictory impulses

**4. Unreliable narration must stem from wounded psychology, not authorial manipulation.** Character genuinely believes their interpretation.

**5. Antagonist POV reveals sympathetic motivation without excusing actions.** Villain's perspective makes them protagonist of their own story.

**6. Sensory details reflect emotional state.** Environment description filtered through character's current mood and wounds.

---

## **SECTION 6: INFORMATION ECONOMY**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Reveal information only when it alters choices, stakes, or relationships.**

**2. Summary/exposition permitted only when dramatization adds no emotional or plot value.**

**3. Flashbacks allowed only when shifting present-day stakes.**

**4. Critical reveals delayed until they create maximum impact and complication.** Early revelation would simplify rather than complicate.

**5. Documents, photos, or physical evidence provide clues character cannot access directly.** Symbolic representations trigger recognition without full understanding.

**6. Memory suppression creates dramatic irony.** Reader may know more than protagonist but gaps remain for both.

### **Forbidden-by-Constraint**

**No information appears unless character thinks, sees, learns, suspects, remembers, fears, or discovers it within story timeline.**

---

## **SECTION 7: GENRE-ALIGNMENT RULES (Urban Fantasy Romance)**

### **Required Elements**

**1. Supernatural world hidden from mundane society through active concealment.** Revelation to uninitiated humans creates danger and complication.

**2. Protagonist operates in both mundane and supernatural spheres with identity conflict.** Cannot seamlessly integrate both worlds.

**3. Fated mate bond (if present) complicates rather than resolves romantic conflict.** Supernatural connection raises consent and autonomy questions.

**4. Power systems exact ongoing cost.** Magic, supernatural abilities, or inherited traits require sacrifice, pain, or corruption.

**5. Ancient supernatural politics impact present-day character decisions.** Centuries-old conflicts manifest in contemporary setting.

**6. Romantic intimacy occurs before emotional trust is earned.** Physical connection precedes vulnerability and relationship security.

**7. Each act must end with irreversible choice closing off previous relationship options.**

### **Allowed When Justified**

**1. Addiction or vice in supernatural characters shows mechanical consequences.** Substance use impacts power, judgment, or vulnerability—never glamorized or consequence-free.

**2. Memory loss as inciting incident only if:**
- Suppression has mechanical cause (curse, spell, trauma)
- Attempting recovery risks death or worse
- Lost memories directly connect to present threat

**3. Prophecy or fate only when:**
- Characters actively resist or reinterpret it
- Fulfillment requires unexpected sacrifice
- "Destined" outcome subverted by choice

**4. Love triangle dynamics only when:**
- Both options represent genuine but incompatible values
- Choice determines character's ultimate identity
- Resolution requires sacrifice, not "having it all"

**5. Betrayal by trusted ally permitted when:**
- Foreshadowed through subtle behavioral inconsistencies minimum 5 scenes prior
- Betrayer has sympathetic motivation revealed in their POV
- Revelation devastates protagonist's support system, not just romantic relationship

### **Forbidden-by-Constraint**

**1. Mate bond cannot override character's explicit resistance to relationship.** Supernatural pull creates temptation and complication but cannot force submission.

**2. Power gained through trauma cannot be "healed away" or retconned.** Abilities earned through suffering remain permanent with ongoing cost.

**3. Supernatural reveals to mundane humans cannot be easily dismissed or forgotten.** Witnesses experience lasting psychological impact or become compromised.

**4. Ancient beings cannot act with modern sensibilities without justification.** Centuries-old characters carry cultural bias and outdated morality unless change is earned through specific experience.

**5. Secret supernatural society cannot function without addressing:**
- How concealment is maintained at scale
- Consequences of exposure
- Power structures governing both worlds

---

## **SECTION 8: RESOLUTION SCOPE & CLOSURE PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules (Series Fiction)**

**1. Book-level conflicts resolve through protagonist's direct actions. Victory is local, not universal.**

**2. World-level problems: exposed, complicated, shifted, or survived—NOT eliminated unless final book.**

**3. Each book answers opening question but raises new questions about larger world.**

**4. Personal/romantic arc reaches transformation or stability. External plot may be unfinished; emotional arc should not be.**

**5. Investigation-driven plots must solve the immediate case while revealing larger conspiracy.**

### **Victory Scope Rules**

**Allowed:** Defeating this antagonist, securing this person's safety, gaining leverage/knowledge, escaping immediate threat

**Prohibited (unless final book):** Toppling regime, ending war/curse, destroying ancient evil, achieving systemic change

### **Conflict Resolution Tiers**

- **Immediate threat** → MUST resolve
- **Relationship arc** → MUST reach turning point
- **Series-level threat** → may worsen/shift/clarify, rarely diminishes

### **Ending Chapter Requirements**

**Must show:** Changed circumstances, emotional aftermath, precarious new normal, acknowledgment larger fight continues

**Must NOT:** Deus ex machina solutions, fast-forward past tensions, narrate "problem solved"

---

## **SECTION 9: SERIES ARCHITECTURE & MULTI-BOOK LOGIC**

### **Three-Tier Conflict Structure**

---

### **TIER 1: Book Question (Resolved This Book)**

**Resolution Rules:**

**1. Must answer definitively by final chapter.** *Yes, no, or "yes but at this cost"—never "to be continued"*

**2. Answer comes from protagonist's choices within this book.**

**3. May create NEW complications but cannot leave question suspended.**

---

### **TIER 2: Series Question (Resolved Final Book Only)**

**Resolution Rules:**

**1. May NOT fully resolve except final book.**

**2. Each book must:** Escalate it, complicate it, shift power within it, reveal hidden aspects, OR force protagonist deeper into it.

**3. Individual book victories shift protagonist's position but cannot eliminate Series Question.**

**Examples:**
- ✅ Defeated lieutenant (not villain)
- ✅ Discovered conspiracy leader (not dismantled conspiracy)
- ✅ Broke curse on one person (not lifted curse from land)
- ❌ "Evil destroyed, magic restored, kingdom saved"

---

### **TIER 3: Romance Arc (Resolved This Book)**

**Resolution Rules:**

**1. Must reach clear turning point by book's end:** HEA, HFN, or tragic separation.

**2. Must be EARNED through:** Shared trials, vulnerability exposing wounds, prioritizing each other, proof they've changed each other.

**3. Romance climax and plot climax intertwined but distinct.**

**Forbidden:**
- ❌ "They'll figure it out next book"
- ❌ "Their love saved the kingdom" (collapsing romance into Series Question)

---

### **Integration Rules**

**1. Book Question should FORCE couple together or tear them apart.**

**2. Romance Arc tested BY Book Question.**

**3. Resolving Book Question + Romance Arc may worsen Series Question.**

---

## **SECTION 10: INTIMACY PROGRESSION & PACING (Adult Romance)**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Physical intimacy and emotional intimacy follow different timelines.** Hate sex, angry sex, attraction-without-trust are valid. Physical acts may precede, contradict, or complicate emotional connection.

**2. First explicit scene at or before 40% mark (midpoint latest).**

**3. Minimum 3-4 intimate scenes, each serving different narrative function.**

**4. Each scene must show PROGRESSION—not necessarily toward trust, but toward:** Escalating obsession, shifting power, emotional complication, revealing vulnerability, or breaking denial.

**5. Intimate scenes immediately followed by crisis, betrayal, or devastating revelation.** Emotional safety never sustained.

### **What Each Scene Must Accomplish**

Minimum ONE of:
- ✅ Reveal hidden truth (vulnerability, wound exposed)
- ✅ Shift power dynamic
- ✅ Create complication ("this changes nothing")
- ✅ Contradict stated position (body betraying words)
- ✅ Raise stakes (can't pretend anymore)
- ✅ Show evolution from previous scenes
- ✅ Force acknowledgment

**Forbidden:**
- ❌ Identical scenes (no evolution)
- ❌ No emotional aftermath
- ❌ First scene after 60%
- ❌ Only one scene total

### **Progression Axes (Choose One)**

**Emotional:** No feelings → Unwanted feelings → Can't deny → Fully vulnerable

**Power Dynamic:** One holds power → Power shifts → Contested/shared → New equilibrium

**Intimacy Level:** Guarded/mechanical → Masks slip → Intentional vulnerability → Fully open

**Denial/Acceptance:** "Means nothing" → "Still means nothing" (but does) → "Can't keep doing this" → "Can't lose you"

---

## **SECTION 11: THEME & TRANSFORMATION PHYSICS**

### **Primary Rules**

**1. Characters never articulate theme directly.**

**2. Characters never name their own transformation.**

**3. Transformation moment must be STRUCTURALLY EXTREME, not symbolically gentle.** Situation itself is dramatic, high-stakes, dangerous. Cost is severe and immediate.

### **Transformation Situation Requirements**

**Must occur when:**

**1. COST IS MASSIVE:** Will destroy me if fails, lose something precious, sacrifice irreversible

**2. RISK IS CATASTROPHIC:** I will die/lose everything, betrayal LIKELY based on evidence, everyone says I'm insane

**3. CHOICE REQUIRES DRAMATIC ACTION:** Not passive acceptance, physically/emotionally gutting, makes reader gasp, cannot be taken back

### **Climax Design Rules**

**Book Question solvable ONLY through extreme theme embodiment.**

**Climax must be designed so:**
1. Transformation is ONLY solution
2. Old pattern available but will fail
3. Cost excruciating and visible
4. Drama at maximum
5. Choice feels impossible

**DO NOT design comfortable, obvious, low-risk, or reversible transformations.**
