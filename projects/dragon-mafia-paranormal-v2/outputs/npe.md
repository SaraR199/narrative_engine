# NARRATIVE PHYSICS ENGINE v1.0
## Paranormal Romance / Urban Fantasy Edition

---

## SECTION 1: CAUSALITY & PLOT LOGIC

### Primary Rules

**1. All plot movement must arise from character investigation, confrontation, or the consequences of prior deceptions—never from coincidence or convenient revelation.**

**2. Supernatural abilities that provide information must extract a proportional physical or psychological cost. The more crucial the information, the more severe the toll.**

**3. Every major revelation must emerge from:
   - Physical evidence discovered through investigation
   - Character mistakes that expose hidden truths
   - Direct confrontation that forces admission
   - Supernatural experiences that leave verifiable traces**

**4. Deceptions and lies must have clear motivations rooted in character wounds, fears, or goals. No character withholds information "just because."**

**5. External magical obstacles (curses, compulsions, memory blocks) must create internal psychological conflict. Characters cannot simply "break" supernatural constraints—they must navigate around them or pay severe costs to breach them.**

**6. Information revealed in one scene must generate new urgent questions that drive the next investigation or confrontation. Each answer creates pressure to seek the next truth.**

**7. No supernatural solution may resolve emotional conflicts. Magic can complicate or reveal, but never repair trust, grief, or broken relationships.**

---

## SECTION 2: CHARACTER ACTION & DECISION PHYSICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Characters make decisions based on incomplete information filtered through their emotional wounds and biases, not objective assessment of situations.**

**2. Characters who "protect" others by withholding information must face escalating consequences that prove their choice made things worse.**

**3. Every major character decision must be driven by one of these forces:
   - Desperate need to know/understand truth
   - Attempt to protect someone from painful knowledge
   - Response to perceived betrayal or abandonment
   - Compulsion from unhealed emotional wound
   - Conflicting loyalties creating impossible choices**

**4. Characters must misinterpret events through their specific psychological lens:
   - The abandoned interpret caution as rejection
   - The obsessed interpret boundaries as temporary obstacles
   - The traumatized interpret normalcy as threat
   - The guilty interpret consequences as punishment**

**5. When characters choose between competing loyalties (duty vs. love, truth vs. protection, past vs. present), the choice must create immediate negative consequences regardless of which option they select.**

**6. Characters cannot "choose better" until they confront the wound driving their harmful pattern. Rational awareness alone never changes behavior.**

### Secondary Rules

**1. Investigative protagonists must pursue truth even when warned it will destroy them. Their need to know overrides survival instinct.**

**2. Characters who manipulate "for love" must genuinely believe they're protecting or saving the target, never acknowledge they're violating autonomy until confronted with undeniable proof.**

**3. Supporting characters must hold crucial information that could prevent tragedy, but withhold it for reasons that seem protective or prudent from their perspective.**

---

## SECTION 3: DIALOGUE PHYSICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Characters evade direct questions through:
   - Answering a different question than asked
   - Providing technically true but deliberately incomplete information
   - Redirecting to emotional/physical intimacy to derail interrogation
   - Claiming protective motivations when pressed**

**2. Crucial information must be revealed through:
   - Accidental slips when character is emotionally compromised (drunk, furious, grief-stricken, lustful)
   - Direct persistent interrogation that corners the liar
   - Character mistakes that reveal knowledge they shouldn't possess
   - Third-party witnesses providing contradictory information**

**3. Every conversation about withheld truth must escalate through these stages:
   - Deflection/charm offensive
   - Partial admission ("half-truth")
   - Defensive justification
   - Silence or retreat when cornered
   - Full reveal only under undeniable pressure**

**4. Characters cannot articulate their deepest fears or needs directly. These must emerge through:
   - What they demand from others
   - What they cannot tolerate losing
   - The specific lies they tell themselves
   - Actions that contradict their stated motivations**

### Conditional Rules

**1. Romantic/sexual dialogue must layer physical desire with emotional manipulation, neither character fully honest about their true vulnerability.**

**2. Interrogation scenes must reveal as much about the questioner (through what they ask and how) as about the person being questioned.**

**3. Exposition delivered through dialogue must be:
   - Actively resisted by the listener who doesn't want it to be true
   - Incomplete, requiring further investigation to verify
   - Motivated by the speaker's need to justify, warn, or manipulate**

---

## SECTION 4: PACING & TIME MECHANICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Expand time for:
   - Physical experiences of supernatural phenomena (visions, transformations, magical pain)
   - Confrontations where lies are exposed
   - Intimate moments interrupted by revelations or external threats
   - Investigative discoveries that change protagonist's understanding of identity
   - Moments where character must choose between competing loyalties**

**2. Compress time for:
   - Travel between locations
   - Routine investigation that yields no new emotional stakes
   - Explanations of supernatural systems (convey through action/discovery, not lecture)
   - Recovery periods between crisis points**

**3. Chapter endings must shift one of these elements:
   - New revelation that recontextualizes prior events
   - Betrayal or trust violation
   - Escalation of external threat (ticking clock)
   - Character isolation (loss of ally or safe space)
   - Discovery of physical evidence that contradicts established "truth"**

**4. POV switches must occur at moments of maximum dramatic irony:
   - Reader learns antagonist's true motivation immediately after protagonist makes wrong assumption
   - Reader sees betrayer's perspective immediately after protagonist extends trust
   - Reader discovers hidden connection immediately after protagonist dismisses possibility**

### Transition Rules

**1. Scene transitions must carry emotional residue. Characters enter new scenes still processing previous trauma, grief, or revelation—never reset to neutral.**

**2. Time jumps must be marked by:
   - Changed physical conditions (wounds healing/worsening, environments altered)
   - References to off-stage actions through evidence of their occurrence
   - Dialogue fragments that reference what happened during the gap
   - Shifted power dynamics between characters**

---

## SECTION 5: POV & EMOTIONAL LOGIC

### Primary Rules

**1. Each POV must be colored by that character's specific emotional wound:
   - The abandoned filter events through lens of rejection and worthlessness
   - The obsessed filter events through lens of destiny and ownership
   - The guilty filter events through lens of debt and punishment
   - The traumatized filter events through lens of threat and survival**

**2. POV character's internal narration must contradict their external behavior when they're:
   - Manipulating someone "for their own good"
   - Hiding pain behind competence or charm
   - Denying their own desperate needs
   - Rationalizing harmful choices through noble motivations**

**3. Physical sensations must convey emotional states:
   - Unwanted attraction = body betraying rational mind
   - Supernatural connection = invasive physical compulsion
   - Memory recovery = violent physical trauma
   - Lies/deception detected = visceral wrongness (cold, nausea, tension)**

**4. Characters must experience conflicting simultaneous emotions without resolving them:
   - Love and rage toward the same person
   - Desperate need for truth and terror of learning it
   - Physical desire and emotional revulsion
   - Gratitude and resentment for protection/interference**

### Secondary Rules

**1. Investigator POVs must show:
   - Cataloging physical evidence even during emotional crisis
   - Professional instincts competing with personal feelings
   - Guilt over objectivity failing when case becomes personal
   - Pattern recognition that bypasses conscious thought**

**2. Supernatural POVs must show:
   - Casual acceptance of impossible as normal
   - Centuries of time creating different emotional scale
   - Predatory instincts in conflict with chosen ethics
   - Power as default solution requiring conscious restraint**

**3. Possessed/influenced POVs must show:
   - Time loss and disorientation
   - Actions performed with skill they don't consciously possess
   - Fragmented awareness of compulsion
   - Post-influence horror at what they did**

---

## SECTION 6: INFORMATION ECONOMY

### Primary Rules

**1. Supernatural revelations must arrive through investigation of physical evidence, never through explanatory conversation unless:
   - The explainer is lying or providing incomplete information
   - The listener actively resists/challenges the explanation
   - The explanation creates new urgent questions**

**2. Memory recovery must be:
   - Triggered by physical objects, locations, or sensory experiences
   - Fragmentary and incomplete, requiring assembly of pieces
   - Violently traumatic, deterring repeated attempts
   - Contradictory to protagonist's assumed identity**

**3. Each character must hold specific pieces of truth they hide for different reasons:
   - Antagonist hides methods and full plan
   - Love interest hides prior knowledge of protagonist's past
   - Ally hides information they think would break protagonist
   - Protagonist's own mind hides memories that threaten survival**

**4. Lies must be revealed through:
   - Liar possessing knowledge they shouldn't have
   - Physical evidence contradicting stated facts
   - Third party providing different version of events
   - Liar's behavior inconsistent with their claimed ignorance**

**5. No information may be revealed through:
   - Overheard conversations intended to inform reader
   - Antagonist monologuing their entire plan
   - Convenient prophesy or vision showing exactly what to do
   - Character suddenly "remembering" crucial detail at perfect moment**

### Forbidden-by-Constraint

**No character may learn crucial information without:
   - Actively investigating despite warnings
   - Paying severe physical or psychological cost
   - Confronting someone who has reason to withhold it
   - Discovering physical evidence that proves the truth**

---

## SECTION 7: GENRE-ALIGNMENT RULES (Paranormal Romance / Urban Fantasy)

### Required Elements

**1. Supernatural Connection Must Complicate, Not Solve:**

   - Supernatural attraction must conflict with emotional trust and rational assessment
   - Physical pull must be acknowledged as potentially violating consent if not questioned
   - Characters must actively wonder whether their feelings are genuine or magically compelled**

**2. Hidden Supernatural World Rules:**
   - Supernatural beings live concealed among humans through glamour, misdirection, or political structures

**5. Urban Fantasy Investigation:**
   - Mundane investigation techniques (evidence collection, interrogation, surveillance) applied to supernatural crimes
   - Protagonist must be professional investigator (detective, FBI, etc.) or obsessive amateur
   - Each clue must be physical evidence that survives supernatural scrutiny
   - Case files, photographs, and forensic evidence serve as touchstones of reality**

**6. Mystery Plot Integration:**
   - External plot (murder investigation, political conspiracy, apocalyptic threat) must parallel internal arc (identity, trust, belonging)
   - Solving external mystery must require confronting internal wounds
   - Red herrings must emerge from character deception, not arbitrary misdirection
   - Final revelation must recontextualize earlier "clues" protagonist dismissed**

### Allowed When Justified

**2. Memory Loss / Amnesia:**
   - Allowed only when memory suppression is active magical constraint, not passive injury

   - Special status must isolate protagonist, not empower them
   - Protagonist must actively resist their "role"

---

## SECTION 8: STAKES & PRESSURE SYSTEM

### Primary Rules

**1. Personal stakes must parallel external stakes:
   - Solving murder mystery = recovering lost identity
   - Preventing apocalypse = reclaiming stolen agency
   - Protecting innocents = forgiving self for past failures
   - Destroying corrupt system = choosing authentic self over false destiny**

**2. Stakes must escalate through loss of safety, not just increased danger:**

   - **Stage 1:** Professional case becomes personally significant
   - **Stage 2:** Safe spaces violated (home invasion, sanctuary compromised)
   - **Stage 3:** Trusted allies revealed as compromised or hostile
   - **Stage 4:** Protagonist's own mind/memories proven unreliable
   - **Stage 5:** Core identity revealed as constructed lie**

**3. Ticking clock must have multiple simultaneous countdowns:**
   - External: antagonist systematically eliminating targets
   - Physical: protagonist's body deteriorating from supernatural strain
   - Emotional: relationships fracturing under weight of revealed lies
   - Cosmic: supernatural deadline (eclipse, tithe, seasonal change) approaching**

**4. Each revelation must force protagonist to question a previous certainty:
   - "I'm losing my mind" → "I have supernatural abilities"
   - "He's helping me" → "He knew truth all along"
   - "She's my only ally" → "She's been controlled by enemy"
   - "I'm the victim" → "I might be the weapon"**

**5. Power escalation must create new vulnerabilities:
   - Gaining supernatural abilities = becoming target for those who fear them
   - Learning truth about past = destabilizing present identity
   - Recovering memories = experiencing trauma fresh again
   - Accepting magical heritage = losing claim to human life/relationships**

### Secondary Rules

**1. No safe harbor can remain safe. Each location must be:**
   - Violated by antagonist's intrusion
   - Revealed as surveillance location
   - Compromised by ally's betrayal
   - Abandoned due to protagonist's transformation**

**2. Every alliance must be tested by:**
   - Revelation of prior deception
   - Conflicting loyalties (duty vs. personal connection)
   - Moral disagreement about acceptable costs
   - Discovery that ally has been compromised**

**3. Antagonist pressure must be psychological before physical:**
   - First: messages proving they know protagonist's secrets
   - Second: violations of private space
   - Third: harm to people protagonist cares about
   - Fourth: direct confrontation only after psychological dominance established**

---

## SECTION 9: OFF-STAGE NARRATIVE DESIGN

### Primary Rules

**1. Antagonist's off-stage actions must be revealed through:**
   - Physical evidence protagonist discovers (placement of objects, surveillance equipment, altered environments)
   - Victims' testimony about what happened during lost time
   - Third-party observations of events protagonist didn't witness
   - Body language and behavior changes in compromised characters**

**2. Time protagonist doesn't witness (blackouts, separations, off-page events) must be:**
   - Reconstructed through investigation of what changed
   - Revealed through other POV chapters showing what actually occurred
   - Source of horror when true events contradict protagonist's assumptions
   - Key to solving mystery when protagonist discovers what happened during gaps**

**3. Characters' pasts must be revealed through:**
   - Physical artifacts (photographs, journals, documents)
   - Conflicting accounts from different witnesses
   - Protagonist's fragmented memories contradicting official story
   - Locations that trigger sense memory**

**4. Supernatural world-building must emerge through:**
   - Characters' casual references revealing their assumptions
   - Protagonist's confusion about normal supernatural practices
   - Political conflicts demonstrating power structures
   - Magical costs demonstrating system constraints**

### Secondary Rules

**1. Antagonist's preparation must be shown through:**
   - Evidence of long-term surveillance
   - Resources they shouldn't have access to
   - Knowledge they couldn't have obtained normally
   - Manipulation of events protagonist thought were coincidence**

**2. Protagonist's lost memories must be revealed through:**
   - Other characters' reactions to protagonist not remembering shared experiences
   - Protagonist's inexplicable skills/knowledge they don't remember learning

---

## SECTION 10: REVELATION & RECONTEXTUALIZATION MECHANICS

### Primary Rules

**1. Every major reveal must reframe previous scenes when reader re-examines them:**
   - "Helpful" advice revealed as manipulation toward planned outcome
   - "Protective" behavior revealed as possessive control
   - "Coincidental" meetings revealed as stalking/surveillance
   - "Mysterious" reactions revealed as recognition protagonist didn't share**

**2. Protagonist must be positioned to notice clues but dismiss them through:**
   - Unreliable narrator believing they're mentally ill
   - Trauma-brain prioritizing survival over pattern recognition
   - Emotional investment in believing ally's lies
   - Professional skepticism rejecting supernatural explanations**

**3. The truth must be worse than protagonist's darkest suspicion in unexpected ways:**
   - Not just "he lied" but "he knew everything from the beginning"
   - Not just "she's compromised" but "she's been controlled for months/years"
   - Not just "I have powers" but "I'm the weapon/anchor/prison"
   - Not just "he loves me" but "he's killed to possess me"**

**4. Clues must be planted through:**
   - Character possessing knowledge they claim not to have
   - Impossibly perfect timing of "coincidental" events
   - Objects appearing/disappearing with no explanation
   - Other characters' confused reactions to protagonist's false assumptions**

### Pattern Recognition Rules

**1. Protagonist's professional skills must provide tools for truth-seeking:**
   - Evidence collection habits applied to personal life
   - Interrogation techniques used on allies
   - Pattern recognition that operates despite emotional investment
   - Documentation creating record that survives magical interference**

**2. Physical evidence must survive magical manipulation:**
   - Photographs retain truth even when human memory is altered
   - Digital records preserve what glamour changes in physical objects
   - Scars/wounds contradict claimed timeline of events
   - Locations contain residue of magical working**

**3. Each revelation must create urgent new question:**
   - "If he lied about this, what else?" → drives investigation of ally
   - "If she's controlled, since when?" → drives timeline reconstruction
   - "If I'm this, what am I capable of?" → drives self-discovery
   - "If past is false, what is true?" → drives identity quest**

---

- Amnesiac or identity-uncertain protagonists
- Romantic relationships complicated by deception, supernatural compulsion, or past obligations
- Murder mystery or conspiracy investigation as external plot
- Hidden supernatural world revealed to protagonist
- Morally complex antagonists driven by love/obsession
