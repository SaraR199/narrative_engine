# Relationship Architecture: Darius Kael & Vivienne Shen

## 1. Relationship Spine

**What binds them together:**
Mutual strategic interest plus asymmetric dependency: Vivienne holds conspiracy intelligence Darius needs; Darius offers protection to the neutral Shen clan. Both are master strategists surrounded by people they perform for—encountering intellectual equals is rare. The unity plan requires convincing pragmatic clans; Vivienne represents this constituency. Her Shadow dragon deception-detection makes her the most dangerous validator of his mate bond and political sincerity.

**What pushes them apart:**
Foundational strategy conflict: Vivienne's perfect neutrality (cornerstone of Shen survival) versus Darius's demand for commitment. Both recognize they're consummate manipulators—she suspects his mate bond is theater and unity plan is power consolidation; he knows she's feeding information to multiple sides. Conflicting values: his idealistic unity vision (pursued through ruthless methods) versus her pure transactional pragmatism. Her deception-detection makes him uncomfortable; she enjoys that discomfort.

**Unresolved emotional truth:**
Both built survival strategies (isolation, neutrality) that completely isolate them from genuine connection. Neither can admit isolation is destroying them, that perfect control and total neutrality are weaknesses disguised as strength. Can calculated alliance beat perfect self-reliance? Both are exhausted by their performances but terrified to drop them. She sees the exhausted man beneath his tyrant mask; he recognizes her weaponized charm conceals loneliness. Neither can acknowledge this without admitting their strategy might be fatally flawed.

## 2. Tension Axes

### Values: Idealistic ↔ Pragmatic

**Darius (Idealistic execution):**
Outwardly idealistic (unity as moral imperative, ending centuries of violence) but executed through ruthless methods. Genuinely wants lasting peace and believes the current system is unsustainable, but defaults to ruthless tactics. Arc: "unity as power consolidation" (Act I) → "unity as genuine partnership" (Act III). His idealism is real but buried beneath cynical execution.

**Vivienne (Pure pragmatist):**
Everything filtered through cost-benefit analysis. Views his idealism as either exploitable weakness or dangerous threat. Believes neutrality is the smartest survival strategy; skeptical dragons can trust after centuries of betrayal.

**How this manifests:**
Darius appeals to collective good; Vivienne counters with "What's my return?" She dissects his unity as a power play. When he shows genuine conviction, she leans forward, drops formality, probes authenticity. He deploys brutal honesty: "You think I want this? Unity means trusting people who'd kill me. But extinction is the alternative." She watches his temperature control (involuntary tells reveal passion) to assess sincerity.

**Arc shift:**
Vivienne moves from "idealism is performance or stupidity" to "calculated partnership might be smartest strategy." She doesn't become idealistic but expands pragmatism to include trust as strategic asset. Existential crisis makes strict neutrality suicidal; commitment becomes survival mathematics. Darius stops hiding idealism beneath ruthless framing and owns that unity requires genuine partnership.

### Trust: Guarded ↔ Calculated Risk

**Darius (Extremely guarded):**
Trusts no one completely, maintains escape routes and emotional distance. Arc: vulnerability impossible (Acts 1-2) → attempting calculated risks on partnership (Acts 3-4). With Vivienne: cannot fully relax (her deception-detection catches his masks) but respects her enough to deploy more honesty. Experimenting with strategic vulnerability.

**Vivienne (Beyond guarded):**
Maintains strategic ambiguity, feeds information to multiple parties, never fully commits. Perfect neutrality as survival strategy and identity. Arc: commitment would be fatal (Acts 1-2) → realizes neutrality becoming a trap as conspiracy escalates (Act 3). Must choose or lose position.

**How this manifests:**
Neither reveals their full hand. Information exchange is carefully portioned—each testing the other. Darius offers alliance terms with incomplete details; Vivienne counters with information fragments. Both catalog what the other protects most (true vulnerabilities). Physical tells: she stands in shadows/near walls; he maintains distance, temperature neutral. As trust increases: she positions normally, uses contractions; his dry wit emerges; temperature control relaxes.

**Arc shift:**
Both move from "trust no one" to "strategic vulnerability with the right ally." Act I: pure negotiation, explicit prices. Act II: she gives intelligence before asked; he shares concern without framing as trade. Act III: efficient collaboration, mutual protection. Still guarded with everyone else—trust specific to demonstrated reliability.

---

## 3. Friction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Verbal Chess / Strategic Positioning

**Trigger:**
Any substantive conversation. Both treat interactions as negotiations where showing genuine position first is losing.

**Escalation:**
Increasingly elaborate verbal parrying. Darius frames unity as inevitable, phrasing questions as commands: "The Shen will commit resources." Vivienne questions embedded assumptions: "Interesting you believe Shen neutrality is negotiable." He offers alliance benefits; she identifies hidden costs. She spins jade bracelet (calculation tell); his temperature drops as he engages control.

**Resolution:**
Usually ends in stalemate—partial information, updated assessments. Occasionally breaks when one deploys brutal honesty: "Stop. What would constitute proof the conspiracy is real?" Creates brief direct communication before defaulting back to positioning. Over time, stalemates shorten as both recognize collaboration is more productive.

### Pattern 2: Information Withholding / Price Negotiation

**Trigger:**
Darius needs conspiracy intelligence Vivienne possesses. His need is leverage; her information is commodity.

**Escalation:**
She makes the price increasingly complex—not just "what will you give me?" but "what does asking this reveal about your position?" She examines nails, sips wine, phrases answers as questions: "What would information about Rothko movements near Volkov ruins be worth?" He counters by offering information she didn't know he possessed, proving alternative sources exist.

**Resolution:**
Transactional exchange where both receive partial information and respect negotiation competence. Over time, prices lower as relationship shifts from transaction to alliance. Act III: information shared before explicit negotiation because mutual benefit is obvious.

### Pattern 3: Shadow Dragon Truth-Testing vs. Fire Dragon Control

**Trigger:**
Vivienne notices when Darius's mask slips—temperature fluctuation discussing Sera, too-quick defensive response, hesitation before answering.

**Escalation:**
She probes deliberately: "Your mate bond performance is quite convincing. Almost too convincing. When did it stop being performance?" He either locks down control (supernaturally still, voice precise, temperature drops) or deploys brutal honesty: "I knew she infiltrated to kill me. I didn't stop her because I wanted to see if she'd actually do it." She watches physical tells to assess authenticity.

**Resolution:**
She gets her answer (authentic revelation or confirmation he concealed, both useful). He learns what she's assessing and why. When he stops performing entirely (Act III), it signals growth—allows her to see exhaustion and vulnerability. Her choice to stop testing and accept his authenticity signals trust formation.

## 4. Connection Patterns

### Pattern 1: Intellectual Respect / Competence Recognition

**Trigger:**
One deploys elegant strategy, demonstrates unexpected knowledge, or predicts the other's move. Mutual recognition of intellectual parity—rare when surrounded by people they must manage.

**What it looks like:**
Genuine smile from Vivienne, dry humor from Darius ("I didn't see that coming. Well played."), brief acknowledgment dropping pretense. Shift from verbal combat to collaborative problem-solving—finishing each other's strategic analyses. Posture relaxes; conversation accelerates, becomes more efficient.

**Vulnerability created:**
Admitting respect acknowledges the other as equal, not asset or obstacle. Creates basis for genuine alliance—both are isolated by competence. Recognition is acknowledgment: "You see me clearly and haven't looked away." Makes betrayal more costly. Each competence recognition builds incremental trust.

### Pattern 2: Shared Understanding of Isolation

**Trigger:**
Moments when their survival strategies' cost becomes visible—Darius's exhaustion with his tyrant role, Vivienne's recognition that her network has no one willing to help without calculating return.

**What it looks like:**
Unguarded admission or silence acknowledging what neither will say directly. Vivienne offering crucial information before asked. Darius sharing genuine concern without framing as tactic: "The conspiracy is deeper than I anticipated. I don't know if unity will be fast enough." Brief eye contact lingers. Her jade bracelet stills; his temperature fluctuates before he catches it.

**Vulnerability created:**
Acknowledging this cost means admitting the strategy might be flawed, that perfect control and neutrality create problems. Opens possibility of calculated alliance. Creates space for the unresolved truth: isolation is a trap, and they're both caught.

### Pattern 3: Pragmatic Alliance / Mutual Benefit

**Trigger:**
External threat (conspiracy escalation, rival clan pressure, Unbound disturbances) affecting both. Shared enemy makes cooperation obviously advantageous.

**What it looks like:**
Efficient collaboration without elaborate negotiation or trust-testing. She provides intelligence; he provides protection. Information exchange is rapid—still don't reveal everything, but no games. Conversations are businesslike—Vivienne drops charm, Darius drops intimidation, both operating as colleagues.

**Vulnerability created:**
Effective partnership demonstrates that calculated alliance beats perfect self-reliance. Each success makes next cooperation easier, building trust through demonstrated reliability. Creates dependence they both notice—she becomes invested in his success, he in protecting her position. Pattern proves genuine alliance beats transaction.

## 5. Relational Arc Phases

### Act I: Baseline Dynamic

**Starting status:**
Strictly political relationship between powerful players with overlapping territories. Mutual wariness—both master manipulators, both dangerous. Vivienne assesses whether his unity plan threatens Shen neutrality. Darius needs her intelligence network and political commitment, treating her as asset to convince. Every conversation is strategic positioning. She enjoys making him uncomfortable with her deception-detection; he respects her competence but views her neutrality as obstacle.

**What keeps them apart:**
- Vivienne's neutrality is cornerstone of Shen survival—cannot abandon without existential justification. His plan requires commitment she won't give.
- Both recognize they're performing: she suspects his mate bond is theater; he knows she's hedging.
- Conflicting values: his idealistic unity reads as exploitable weakness or power grab. Her transactional thinking reads as proof she'll abandon alliance if odds shift.
- Her deception-detection makes him uncomfortable; she enjoys this power.
- Matriarch Mei pressures her to maintain strict neutrality.

**What prevents deeper connection:**
- Neither trusts anyone—professional paranoia meets calculated neutrality.
- Darius treats her as asset to convince, not ally to partner with.
- Vivienne sees his unity as performance.
- Cultural gulf: Kael values strength; Shen values information.

**Unspoken wants:**
- **Darius wants:** Shen intelligence network, proof pragmatic clans can commit, validation his plan is viable, someone who sees through his mask but doesn't fear him (intellectual equal).
- **Vivienne wants:** His true agenda, favorable Shen positioning regardless of outcome, truth about Sera and the mate bond, proof genuine alliance beats perfect neutrality.

### Midpoint: Shift

**Catalyst for change:**
1. **Genuine intimacy observed:** Vivienne notices Darius and Sera's "performance" has authenticity tells—unconscious protective instincts, reactions too fast to calculate, elemental resonance. Questions whether the mate bond is theater.

2. **Conspiracy escalation proves real threat:** Her intelligence reveals far deeper conspiracy. Realizes if Unbound wake fully, her information network becomes worthless. Strict neutrality is becoming a trap.

3. **Genuine partnership observed:** She sees him choosing partnership over domination with a rival alpha—sharing authority, making concessions, choosing trust when control would be easier. Contradicts her "power grab" theory.

4. **Complicity discovered:** She realizes she's been feeding information to conspiracy-connected contacts. Her neutrality made her complicit, not safe.

**New trust:**
- Vivienne gives crucial conspiracy information before asked—testing if alliance beats transaction. No explicit price.
- Darius reciprocates with genuine vulnerability: admits he doesn't know if unity will be fast enough.
- Both experiment with strategic vulnerability.

**New conflict:**
- Matriarch Mei views her shift toward alliance as dangerous sentimentality. Demands she expose Darius's secrets or face replacement as heir.
- Rival clans question her trustworthiness, suggesting she's become Kael asset.
- Her neutrality burns with each alliance move; retreat becomes progressively more expensive.

**Axis shifts:**
- **VALUES:** Vivienne expands pragmatic definition. Sometimes riskiest investment is smartest long-term strategy.
- **TRUST:** Both experiment with calculated vulnerability. Share information without immediate transaction.

**Possibilities/impossibilities:**
- **Possible:** Political alliance based on aligned interests, Shen network actively supporting unity, Vivienne as strategic colleague.
- **Impossible:** Returning to pure neutrality, maintaining strategic ambiguity, purely transactional relationship.

### Act III: Convergence or Rupture

**Final trajectory:**
Convergence—evolution into genuine political alliance between equals (still fundamentally pragmatic).

**Defining moment:**
Vivienne discovers the conspiracy's architect is someone she's been feeding information to for years—neutrality made her complicit, not protected. She must choose: maintain neutrality (immediate safety but doomed if Unbound destroy clan structure) or publicly commit to alliance (risky, permanent enemies, violates Shen principles and her mother's directives).

She chooses to expose the traitor using Shadow dragon abilities, revealing her allegiance and burning neutrality forever. This choice is calculated assessment that alliance offers better survival odds than neutrality in existential crisis, influenced by watching Sera's transactional-free loyalty, Darius's demonstrated partnership, and recognition that isolation was destroying her. She adapts her survival strategy based on new data rather than becoming sentimental.

**Thematic connection:**
Her arc demonstrates that perfect control and total neutrality weaken rather than protect. The conspiracy succeeds partly through isolation—her evolution proves strategic vulnerability and alliance can be more effective than self-reliance. She doesn't abandon her transactional nature but expands her framework to include trust and partnership as strategic assets. It's evolution of survival strategy, not redemption arc.

**Gains and losses:**

**Darius gains:**
- Shen intelligence network and Shadow dragon expertise (decisive final advantage)
- Proof pragmatic clans can commit based on strategic merit (if Vivienne commits, others follow)
- Ally who chose his plan through calculated assessment, not coercion
- Colleague who sees through his mask and stays
- Strategic partner who challenges assumptions and prevents ruthless backsliding

**Darius loses:**
- Comfortable assumption everyone operates transactionally
- Option to treat allies as disposable (she invested; he's now responsible)
- Strategic flexibility (her public commitment ties her fate to his success)

**Vivienne gains:**
- Alliance with strongest coalition and best stability odds
- Genuine colleague relationship with intellectual equal
- Expanded value definition (trust as strategic asset, partnership as force multiplier)
- Survival strategy without complete isolation

**Vivienne loses:**
- Neutrality (cornerstone of Shen identity, decades of investment)
- Mother's approval and heir position
- Information broker role (burned bridges with rival clans)
- Plausible deniability

## 6. Pressure Points

1. **Shen Neutrality Challenged / Clan Identity Threatened**
   - **Why it matters:** Neutrality is centuries-old Shen survival strategy. Abandoning it violates Mei's teachings and clan identity, potentially costing Vivienne her heir position. It's existential—threatening identity itself.
   - **Darius (Arc I-II):** Treats neutrality as obstacle, applies subtle pressure, frames commitment as inevitable. (Arc III): Recognizes genuine cost, acknowledges sacrifice explicitly, ensures protection commensurate with risk.
   - **Vivienne:** Intensely controlled calculation, runs scenarios obsessively. Torn between safe proven neutrality and risky existential alliance. Delays commitment until odds overwhelmingly favor alliance or neutrality becomes untenable.
   - **Pivot:** Breaks if treated as inevitable obligation rather than costly sacrifice. Deepens if he explicitly acknowledges what she's sacrificing and ensures protection.

2. **Shadow Dragon Truth-Detection During Fake Mate Bond Performance**
   - **Why it matters:** Her deception-detection makes her the hardest validator of Sera and Darius's bond. If she doesn't believe it, no one will—dooming legitimacy. Her assessment carries weight with clans.
   - **Darius:** Hyper-aware of her scrutiny, temperature control becomes conscious effort. Deploys calculated honesty—admits truths to sell larger lie. As real bond forms, genuine feelings ironically make performance more convincing.
   - **Vivienne:** Fascinated and suspicious equally. Notices genuine intimacy tells mixed with performance. Cannot fully reconcile contradictions. Probes constantly: "When did it stop being theater?"
   - **Pivot:** She could expose the bond as theater publicly. Deepens when she notices it becoming real and chooses strategic silence—her choice not to weaponize knowledge is alliance investment.

3. **Information Traced Back to Her / Source Exposure**
   - **Why it matters:** Her power base is information brokering. If her intelligence gets traced to her, clans see her as Kael asset, destroying decades-built network.
   - **Darius (Arc I-II):** Uses information effectively without protecting her position. (Arc III): Must balance effective information use with protecting her position and sources.
   - **Vivienne:** Watches how he deploys her intelligence. Furious if he burns sources for short-term gain. Deep respect if he protects network even when revealing source would be easier.
   - **Pivot:** Breaks if treated as expendable. Deepens if he protects her interests despite costs—proves genuine alliance.

4. **Matriarch Mei's Ultimatum / Family vs. Alliance**
   - **Why it matters:** Vivienne's power includes her position as Mei's heir. Mei demanding she expose Darius's secrets or face replacement forces impossible choice: family position versus independent judgment.
   - **Darius (Arc I-II):** Might exploit her conflict. (Arc III): Cannot interfere with Shen politics without proving he threatens autonomy. Must trust her choice without pressure.
   - **Vivienne:** Torn between craved maternal approval (never fully received, knows it's transactional) and her assessment that alliance is best strategy. Mei's framing mirrors her own transactional patterns—forces confronting isolation's cost.
   - **Pivot:** Breaks if Darius assumes automatic choice or manipulates during conflict. Deepens when she chooses alliance and he explicitly acknowledges cost.

5. **Discovered She Fed Information to Conspiracy Architect**
   - **Why it matters:** Her neutrality strategy made her unknowingly complicit. She provided intelligence to the architect for years. Guilt plus recognizing neutrality was illusion—sitting on fence made her a tool, not safe.
   - **Darius (Arc I-II):** Could exploit guilt, frame her as conspirator. (Arc III): Focuses on solution (exposing traitor together) rather than blame. Frames error as shared problem.
   - **Vivienne:** Horror at being used, fury at herself for missing deception. Crystallizes that neutrality is not safety—existential crisis means choosing sides or being exploited.
   - **Pivot:** Could retreat to isolation or nihilistic exposure of secrets. Deepens if Darius treats her error as shared enemy success rather than personal failure.

## 7. Dialogue & Subtext

### How They Speak to Each Other

**Darius → Vivienne:**
Economical speech with his signature style (declarative, strategic ambiguity, commands as inevitabilities) but more brutal honesty, less performance than with others. Treats her as intellectual equal—doesn't waste time on intimidation. Uses dry wit more frequently: "You tried extracting the same information three ways. I'm almost offended you thought I wouldn't notice."

She detects lies through micro-expressions and temperature tells, so he uses technically-true partial truths or direct admissions. Addresses subjects directly: "The conspiracy uses blood magic. I need your intelligence network to track patterns. What's your price?" Less performance, more chess match between equals.

**Distinct from others:** Council = authoritative commands. Rival alphas = dominance/intimidation. Sera = verbal sparring. Vivienne = collegial intellectual combat, equal recognition, efficient communication.

**Vivienne → Darius:**
Deliberate precision, minimal filler, structured as observations or questions (maintains deniability): "Interesting you're asking about blood magic patterns. One might wonder what you've discovered." Uses pauses strategically—sips wine, examines nails, lets silence build.

Code-switches less with him than others—maintains businesslike tone because he appreciates efficiency. Phrases crucial information as questions: "If someone observed Rothko movements near Volkov ruins matching blood ritual timing, what would that suggest?"

When genuinely curious (rare), drops formality entirely—uses contractions, becomes direct, leans forward: "When did it stop being performance with her? I need to know if you're attempting this or reading theater as authenticity."

**Distinct from others:** Sera = warmer, testing through advice, fascinated by authenticity. Enemies = coldly formal threats. Mei = performatively dutiful. Darius = efficient, intellectually engaged, minimal pretense.

### Unspoken Wants

**Darius wants but doesn't say:**
- Validation his unity plan is viable strategy, not delusional idealism
- Someone who sees through his mask but doesn't fear him, treats him as complete person
- Proof pragmatic clans can commit genuinely (if she—most skeptical—won't commit, plan likely doomed)
- Her respect specifically, acknowledging his competence and vision
- Confirmation that choosing vulnerability and partnership over isolation isn't naive weakness

**Vivienne wants but doesn't say:**
- To know if genuine alliance beats perfect neutrality
- His actual agenda stripped of positioning
- Proof trust won't be weaponized, that investing in alliance won't end in betrayal
- Validation that strategic commitment over neutrality is smartest strategy, not sentiment
- Someone who sees her calculation and isolation and doesn't look away

### Consistent Misreadings

**Darius misreads Vivienne:**
- Assumes neutrality is purely strategic (misses mother's conditioning, isolation response, core identity)
- Sees information trading as purely transactional (misses genuine curiosity about partnership)
- Views testing as threat assessment only (misses that she's testing if he can be different leader)
- Assumes eventual commitment comes from self-interest alone (misses that Sera and his partnership attempts are shifting her worldview)
- Treats confidence as invulnerability (misses her craving for mother's approval)

**Vivienne misreads Darius:**
- Initially assumes mate bond is pure political theater (misses real bond forming)
- Interprets unity talk as power grab or exploitable idealism (misses genuine conviction)
- Sees ruthless methods as complete identity (misses the exhausted man wanting different path)
- Assumes he'll treat her as disposable once extracting what he needs (takes time recognizing he values long-term alliance)
- Interprets strategic positioning as incapability for vulnerability (misses his honesty with her exceeds anyone except Sera)

## 8. Usage Notes for Scene Writing

When writing scenes between Darius and Vivienne, signal the act phase through these patterns:

### Act I Scenes: Pure Strategic Positioning

Every statement is calculated move in verbal chess. Information exchange requires elaborate negotiation with explicit prices. Neither shows vulnerability—all interactions are performance and assessment.

**Active patterns:** Friction Pattern 1 (Verbal Chess) dominates. Friction Pattern 2 (Information Withholding) structures exchanges. Friction Pattern 3 (Truth-Testing vs. Control) creates tension.

**Physical cues:** Vivienne positions in shadows/near walls, spins jade bracelet, elaborate charm. Darius maintains perfect temperature control (cold, neutral), strategic silence, economical speech. Careful physical distance, formal patterns, no contractions.

**Emotional tenor:** Mutual wariness, intellectual engagement, strategic respect with fundamental mistrust.

### Act II Scenes: Cracks in Performance

Brutal honesty interrupts strategic exchange. Shared frustration with isolation becomes visible. Information occasionally given before asked. Competence recognition creates brief genuine connection windows.

**Active patterns:** All friction patterns active but shorter, interrupted by Connection Pattern 1 (Intellectual Respect). Connection Pattern 2 (Shared Isolation) appears in unguarded moments.

**Physical cues:** Darius's temperature control slips (heat spike when passionate). Vivienne drops formality occasionally, leans forward with genuine curiosity, positions more normally. Still guarded but less rigid. More eye contact, closer proximity.

**Emotional tenor:** Intellectual sparring mixed with emerging respect. Curiosity about genuine transformation. Testing strategic vulnerability viability.

### Act III Scenes: Collegial Alliance

Strategic positioning becomes collaborative problem-solving. Information sharing is efficient without negotiation—both contribute to shared investigation. Explicitly acknowledge costs. Work as partners addressing shared threat.

**Active patterns:** Friction Pattern 1 transformed—verbal chess becomes collaborative analysis. Connection Pattern 3 (Pragmatic Alliance) predominates. Connection Pattern 1 is baseline assumption.

**Physical cues:** Vivienne uses contractions freely, stands in normal lighting, jade bracelet still. Darius deploys dry humor readily, temperature regulation mostly unconscious, shares genuine strategic concerns. Normal conversational distance, relaxed postures.

**Emotional tenor:** Mutual respect, genuine collaboration, acknowledged interdependence. Fundamentally pragmatic (not sentimental) but partnership is real.

### Scene-Specific Guidance

**Negotiation scenes:** Use Friction Pattern 2. Intelligence has price; prices lower across arc. Act I: elaborate negotiation. Act II: streamlined with occasional gifts. Act III: shared because mutual benefit is obvious.

**Public/political scenes:** Both perform for clans while conducting subtext through micro-expressions and word choice. Vivienne reads his involuntary tells; he's hyper-aware of her assessment.

**Crisis/conspiracy scenes:** External threat forces collaboration. Show efficient teamwork when interests align—complementary skills. Use Connection Pattern 3. Evolution: Act I = temporary cooperation with exits, Act III = seamless partnership.

**Mate bond testing scenes:** Vivienne probes whether bond is genuine. Use Friction Pattern 3. She watches involuntary tells. He decides whether to maintain performance or admit truth. Her choice to expose or protect signals alliance formation.

**Arc progression indicators:**
- **Temperature control:** Perfect cold → conscious regulation with slips → mostly unconscious, comfortable
- **Information pricing:** Complex negotiation → streamlined with gifts → shared for obvious mutual benefit
- **Speech formality:** Elaborate positioning, no contractions → mixed formal/direct → efficient, contractions normal
- **Physical positioning:** Shadows/walls, distance → normal positioning → relaxed, conversational distance
- **Respect acknowledgment:** Rare and grudging → emerging and genuine → baseline assumption

Vivienne is the barometer: if Darius convinces her, others follow; if he can't, the plan likely dooms. Every conversation carries political weight.
