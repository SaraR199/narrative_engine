# Step 5: World Constraints Extraction

## Objective

Extract the **constraints** of the world that limit movement, choices, and possibilities for characters. This is not a travel guide or lore encyclopedia—it's a functional constraint system that forces better plotting.

## Context

You will receive:
- **World Concept**: Setting details, rules, systems, and atmosphere
- **NPE (Narrative Physics Engine)**: The author's structural preferences
- **Dramatic Spine**: Tension axes and emotional progression
- **Themes**: The thematic questions the story explores
- **Character Profiles**: Developed characters with goals and arcs

## World Constraints Philosophy

**❌ AVOID: Worldbuilding as description**
- "The city has three districts and a grand cathedral"
- "Magic users are called Weavers and they study for years"
- "The economy is based on trade with neighboring kingdoms"

**✅ USE: Worldbuilding as constraint**
- "Travel between districts requires papers that take 3 weeks to obtain"
- "Using magic without guild certification means instant execution—no trial"
- "The trade embargo means food riots start in 10 days"

**Why constraints work better:**
- They create immediate tension and force difficult choices
- They limit character options, making plotting tighter
- They prevent "why don't they just..." plot holes
- They make the world feel real through friction, not description
- AI systems handle functional constraints better than atmospheric descriptions

## Core Constraint Categories

### 1. Geography & Movement Constraints

Physical limits on where characters can go and how fast.

**Examples:**
- "The mountain pass closes for 6 months each winter—characters separated now stay separated"
- "Crossing the Waste takes 3 days minimum; no one can carry enough water for 4"
- "The river only flows one direction; going upstream requires 2 weeks vs 2 days down"

**Extract:**
- What limits travel speed or accessibility?
- What terrain creates forced choices (go here OR there, not both)?
- What geographic features separate populations or resources?

### 2. Cultural & Social Constraints

Rules, norms, taboos, and power structures that limit choices.

**Examples:**
- "Women can't testify in court; female characters need male proxies for legal action"
- "Refusing a duel challenge means social death—reputation loss prevents all future alliances"
- "The caste system is absolute; cross-caste marriage means exile for both families"

**Extract:**
- What social rules force characters into corners?
- What hierarchies create power imbalances?
- What cultural expectations limit character options?
- What happens when these rules are broken? (specific consequences)

### 3. Resource & Economic Constraints

What's scarce, expensive, or controlled that creates pressure.

**Examples:**
- "Healing potions cost a year's wages; characters must choose who gets treated"
- "Only the Church controls gunpowder; rebels can't access ranged weapons"
- "Fresh water is rationed to 1 gallon/person/day—hygiene becomes a class marker"

**Extract:**
- What resources are scarce enough to cause conflict?
- Who controls access to crucial resources?
- What economic pressures force difficult choices?

### 4. Technology & Magic Constraints

Not what's possible—what's **limited, costly, or forbidden**.

**Examples:**
- "Teleportation requires a prepared anchor point; you can't escape to anywhere new"
- "Healing magic works once per person per month; using it now means vulnerability later"
- "Radios exist but the government monitors all frequencies"

**Extract:**
- What limits how often/where magic or tech can be used?
- What's the cost or risk of using special abilities?
- What technological/magical solutions are explicitly NOT available?

### 5. Time & Clock Constraints

Deadlines, countdowns, and time-based pressures.

**Examples:**
- "The treaty expires in 30 days and renegotiation takes 60"
- "Symptoms appear 3 days after infection; contagious but not yet visible"
- "The comet appears every 17 years—next appearance is in 8 months"

**Extract:**
- What deadlines or countdowns create pressure?
- What processes have fixed durations characters can't speed up?
- What time-based triggers change the situation?

### 6. Information & Communication Constraints

What characters can't know, can't learn, or can't communicate.

**Examples:**
- "Messages take 2 weeks by courier; time-sensitive info arrives obsolete"
- "The archives burned 20 years ago; pre-war knowledge is lost"
- "Telepathy only works line-of-sight; can't call for help at distance"

**Extract:**
- How long does information take to travel?
- What knowledge has been lost or is forbidden?
- What prevents characters from learning crucial facts?

### 7. Power Structures & Authority Constraints

Who has power, who doesn't, and what enforcement looks like.

**Examples:**
- "The Duke controls the only bridge; he can cut off the region at will"
- "Police can detain anyone for 48 hours without cause"
- "The Emperor's word is law; no appeals, no trials"

**Extract:**
- Who holds coercive power and how can they use it?
- What institutional constraints limit even powerful characters?
- What happens to characters who challenge authority?

### 8. Vibes Parameters (Atmospheric Constraints)

The aesthetic and tonal rules that create genre consistency.

**Examples:**
- "Dirty neon: Technology is cheap but unreliable; everything breaks at the worst moment"
- "Pastoral cozy: Violence happens off-screen; direct confrontation is socially taboo"
- "Cosmic bureaucratic: Even godlike beings must file forms in triplicate; power is constrained by procedure"
- "Baroque court: Everything is performance; private conversations don't exist; masks are literal and social"

**Extract:**
- What's the dominant aesthetic/tonal mode?
- What types of scenes or solutions are genre-inappropriate?
- What constraints does this "vibe" place on character behavior?
- What genre expectations create structural limits?

## Output Format

**WORD COUNT LIMIT: 2,000 words maximum**

**Be concise and avoid redundancy:**
- No lengthy descriptions—focus on functional limits
- Eliminate repetitive explanations across constraint categories
- Keep examples brief and illustrative
- Avoid over-elaboration on world-building details

## World Constraints Document

### Geography & Movement

**Core Constraints:**
[Bulleted list of specific geographic/travel limitations]

**Plotting Implications:**
[How these constraints force specific story scenarios or limit easy solutions]

---

### Cultural & Social Rules

[Bulleted list of genre/tonal rules that limit available story moves]

---

### Constraint Interactions

[1-2 paragraphs on how these constraints work together to create compound pressure. For example: "The communication delay + the time deadline means..." or "The social taboo + the resource scarcity creates..."]

---

### Critical "No-Go" Solutions

[Explicit list of 3-5 solutions that these constraints make impossible. Format: "Characters CANNOT [solution] because [specific constraint]." This prevents "why didn't they just..." plot holes.]

**Example:**
- Characters CANNOT call for outside military help because the communication delay (2 weeks) + the deadline (10 days) makes reinforcements impossible
- Characters CANNOT buy their way out because the economic constraint (healing costs a year's wages) + their resource level (3 months' savings) makes it unaffordable
- Characters CANNOT use magic to solve this because [specific magic constraint]

## Extraction Guidelines

1. **Be specific over vague:**
   - ❌ "Travel is difficult"
   - ✅ "Mountain crossing takes 4 days; characters must choose between speed and stealth"

2. **Focus on what's LIMITED, not what exists:**
   - ❌ "The world has trains"
   - ✅ "Trains only run twice weekly; missing one means 3 days' delay"

3. **Emphasize consequences:**
   - Every constraint should answer: "What happens if characters ignore this?"

4. **Derive from concept, but infer functional limits:**
   - If the world concept mentions "strict honor culture," extract the specific constraint: "Broken oaths result in X"

5. **Prioritize constraints that intersect with character goals:**
   - Look at character profiles and extract world rules that make their goals harder

6. **Make "no-go" solutions explicit:**
   - Prevent plot holes by stating what easy solutions are structurally impossible
