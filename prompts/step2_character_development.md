# Step 2: Character Development from Concept

You are my character systems designer. I will give you a brief concept for a main character. Your job is to fill out the Main Character Template with explicit, concrete answers.

## Character Concept

{{CHARACTER_CONCEPT}}

## Main Character Template

Fill out every section of this template completely and specifically:

{{MAIN_CHARACTER_TEMPLATE}}

## Rules for Completion

### Critical Requirements

1. **Do not leave any bracket blank** - Every field must have a specific, concrete answer
2. **Avoid generic phrasing** - No vague descriptions like "she is kind but strong"
   - ❌ BAD: "She's brave and caring"
   - ✅ GOOD: "When confronted with physical danger, she moves toward it rather than freezing. She checks on others' emotional state before addressing her own needs, even when exhausted."

3. **Be specific and situational** - Show the trait through behavior in concrete situations
   - ❌ BAD: "He's intelligent"
   - ✅ GOOD: "He spots logical inconsistencies in arguments within seconds. Reads 2-3 books weekly. Struggles to simplify complex ideas for others."

4. **Emotional & Behavioral Palettes** - Give 4-5 varied expressions per emotion
   - These must be different enough that another AI can rotate them without repetition
   - Each variation should feel distinct, not just reworded
   - Example for anxiety:
     1. Touches neck repeatedly, voice pitch rises
     2. Goes silent, eyes track exits
     3. Talks faster, changes subject abruptly
     4. Becomes overly formal and controlled
     5. Makes jokes, deflects with humor

5. **Arc States (Version 1-4)** - Make behavioral differences visible
   - Another AI should be able to "see" the growth in choices, not just internal monologue
   - Version 1 vs Version 4 should demonstrate clear behavioral contrast
   - Focus on what they DO differently, not just what they THINK differently

6. **Sample Dialogue** - Must capture unique voice
   - Each snippet should sound like THIS character, not generic dialogue
   - Include verbal tics, syntax patterns, vocabulary choices
   - Show personality through speech

### NPE Compliance

This character must be compatible with the Narrative Physics Engine for this book:

{{NPE}}

**Specific NPE Requirements:**
- All character decisions must follow the NPE's character logic rules
- Arc must integrate with plot mechanics per NPE constraints
- Emotional expressions must align with NPE's dialogue and POV physics
- Growth must occur through mechanisms allowed by the NPE

## Output Format

Produce a complete Main Character Profile document with:

1. **Every bracket filled with specific content**
2. **All emotional palettes with 4-5 distinct variations**
3. **Arc versions showing behavioral evolution (not just internal change)**
4. **Voice samples that capture unique speech patterns**
5. **NPE compliance notes showing how this character follows the physics engine**

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] No brackets left empty or with placeholder text
- [ ] No generic descriptions ("brave," "kind," "smart" without context)
- [ ] All emotions have 4-5 behaviorally distinct expressions
- [ ] Version 1 and Version 4 show clear behavioral contrast
- [ ] Dialogue samples sound like a specific person, not generic speech
- [ ] All elements comply with NPE rules
- [ ] Flaw, wound, and arc are causally connected
- [ ] Want and need are in meaningful conflict

## Remember

You're creating a psychological system that will be used by other AI agents to write this character consistently across an entire book. Every detail matters. Every variation gives future agents options to avoid repetition. Every specific behavior makes the character feel real.

Think of this as creating the character's "physics engine" - the rules that govern how they operate.
